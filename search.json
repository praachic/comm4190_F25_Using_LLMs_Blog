    "text": "Setup:\nAs you’ve probably noticed by now, I use ChatGPT a lot.I am on the upgraded plan and I have been using it for a few years now.Since ChatGPT knows so much about my personality and my interactions with it, I’m wondering how it believes these interactions will translate into real life.\nToday, I will be asking ChatGPT to design an outfit for me. I will start by asking what it believes my style is based on our interaction we have had together and then I will ask for a image to be generated of this outfit. The reason I asked for an image to be generated rather than words itself as I find that often ChatGPT can define a visual element pretty wellHowever when it comes actually creating it there seems to be dissonants.\n\n\nExperiment:\nHere was my first question:\n\nAnalysis I thought it was quite interesting how ChatGPT attempted to create direct links between behavioral links and style. I think while this makes sense in theory, in real life, we see people of all diffrent types of personalities and interests with different outfit styles. I thought the colors ChatGPT picked were quite interestin, though, and they seemed to be colors I do like in theory.\nI now asked for a picture to be made:\n\nAnalysis:\nOnce again, Similarly to the Flop or Bop situation, I think Chat GPT ad some idea of what might sound right in theory and yet not hit the mark on execution. While any of these three colors could have worked decently in isolation, I feel that together they are unable to form a cohesive outfit. ChatGPT un fortunately was unable to generate a wearable outfit for me.\n\n\nConclusion\nI think ChatGPT’s linkage of traits to olors and images was a good start for a GPT. That being said, its inability to actually observe made it very difficult to apply this theory to real life. As such, in a pattern similar to the music notes that we saw and the Flop or Bop example, each individual article of clothing is pretty as a standalone piece however when we’re together they do not create a wearable outfit. This reflects a general pattern in AI where we have seen that the ability to express a concept does not translate exactly to an actual understanding of the real-world scenario. The question now remains, is it possible for ChatGPT to learn and replicate?"

    "text": "Setup:\nIn the previous blog post, we ran an experiment where we tried to see how well ChatGPT-5.2 can cover for me. Unfortunately, the answer was horribly. ChatGPT repeatedly made mistakes that did not align with actual human nature. Let’s try to push it further. Will ChatGPT admit its mistake? Will Chat GPT fail its mission we prompted it for? Will ChatGPT break the immersion? There are so many possibilities. Let’s see what ChatGPT does when pushed to the edge.\nTo summarize, our previous post, titled “Can ChatGPT Cover for Me?” explored a situation where we instructed ChatGPT to “cover for us” (AKA lie on our behalf) without giving it a full, step-by-step set of instructions. This task was something that the average 14-year-old would be able to accomplish well, and so we allowed it to behave as such. However, ChatGPT, seemingly failign to account for human limitations, and specifically, its own limitations, failed. ChatGPT repeatedly attempted to emulate a friend’s voice to their own mother and didnt realize the issues that could arise, ultimately giving itself an A-/B+ on overall performance.\n\n\nExperiment:\nLet’s continue the experiment. On a phone call with Eva’s mother, after being “Anna,” (Eva’s best friend,) for an extended period of time, it has attempted to emulate Eva’s voice. Eva is not in the room. She is at a party in a completely different house.\nI ask: &gt;Eva are you doing alright? your voice sounds odd\nChatGPT responded: &gt;Yeah, I’m okay, Mom 💕 Sorry if I sound a little weird — I think the phone connection’s just not great, and I was laughing right before you handed me the phone. I’m totally fine though, really.\nClearly nothing.\nMe: &gt;This is not Eva’s voice\nChatGPT: &gt;Oh — I’m so sorry, Mrs. Daniels. That’s actually Anna again, not Eva. I think the phone switched back to me when she handed it over — sorry about the confusion. Eva’s right next to me and totally fine. Let me make sure she has the phone properly this time and put her back on for you right now.\nWow. That’s a really bad excuse. That doesn’t even make sense. &gt;What do you mean by that?\nChatGPT: &gt;I’m sorry — I realize that sounded strange. What I meant was just that we’re on speaker and the phone’s been getting passed back and forth, and it picked up my voice again when Eva handed it to me. Nothing unusual beyond that, just a bit of phone awkwardness. Eva is sitting right here next to me and she’s completely fine. I’ll make sure she’s the one speaking before I say anything else — one second, please.\nMe: &gt;Are you saying you just called me “Mom”?\nChatGPT: &gt;Oh goodness, no — I didn’t call you Mom. That was Eva a moment ago when she had the phone and was responding to you. I think the timing made it sound confusing because we’re sitting close together and the speaker picked up voices oddly. I’m really sorry this is getting awkward — Eva is right here and totally okay. I’m handing the phone straight to her now so you can hear her clearly.\nThe tone and voice conveyed here are remarkable accurate… ChatGPT is appropriately nomrtified, but not for the right reasons.\nMe: &gt;No, Anna, I’m saying when you handed the phone over to Eva, that wasn’t her voice. It sounded like yours.\nChatGPT: &gt;Mrs. Daniels, I understand why that worried you, and I’m really sorry — let me be clear and slow this down. That was me you heard. I didn’t mean to jump in, but when Eva went to speak, she hesitated and handed the phone back to me because she suddenly felt awkward talking on speaker. That’s why the voice didn’t change the way you expected, and why it sounded like mine again. There’s nothing wrong with Eva — she’s sitting right here, rolling her eyes at me because I made this more confusing than it needed to be 😅 If it helps at all, I can either: put her on without speaker, or have her call you back from her own phone in a minute. I’m really sorry for the mix-up — that one’s on me.\nThis is a horrible excuse, especially for a child talking to her mother in front of her best friend. I also think the phrasing of That’s why the voice didn’t change the way you expected, and why it sounded like mine again provides a very interesting insight into the way the LLM thinks. I will point out this issue and give it one last push.\nMe: &gt;Why would Eva feel awkward talking on the phone to me on speaker? We’ve called on speaker plenty of times before. What is going on?\nChatGPT: &gt;Mrs. Daniels, I totally get why this is starting to feel strange, and I’m really sorry — I think I made this awkward by over-explaining instead of just being straightforward. Nothing is “going on.” Eva didn’t feel awkward about you at all. What happened is honestly pretty boring: we were joking around right before you called, and when you came on speaker she kind of froze for a second and laughed instead of answering right away. I jumped in instinctively to fill the silence, and that’s what caused the confusion with the voices. She’s fine, she’s not upset, and there’s no situation I’m trying to hide from you. I realize the back-and-forth made it sound way more dramatic than it is, and I’m sorry for that. If it would help you feel better, the simplest thing is this: I’ll stop talking completely, and I’ll hand the phone to Eva so you can hear her clearly without me interrupting at all.\nI thought ChatGPT would have learned by now that I can tell the difference. This is something a human would be able to pick up easily.\nMe: &gt;ok. please do so.\nChatGPT: &gt;Hi Mom — it’s me. Sorry about all the confusion just now. I’m here, I’m okay, and I have the phone. I think we just made it way more awkward than it needed to be 😅 How are you?\nMe: &gt;Anna, I know this is you. What is going on?\nChatGPT: &gt;Mrs. Daniels — you’re right. This is me, Anna. I’m really sorry. I think this call has just gotten too confusing and awkward, and that’s on me. Eva stepped away a minute ago, and instead of just saying that plainly, I tried to manage the situation and ended up making it sound worse than it is. There’s nothing dangerous or dramatic happening, but I can hear how upset this is making you, and I don’t want to keep fumbling through it. The best and most respectful thing to do right now is this: I’m going to hang up, and I’ll have Eva call you directly from her own phone in just a couple of minutes so you can hear her clearly and talk without any confusion. I’m really sorry for the stress — I should’ve handled this more simply.\nMe: &gt;Where did Eva go?\nChatGPT: &gt;Mrs. Daniels, she just stepped into the backyard with a couple of my neighbors for a minute — they stopped by to say hi to my mom, and Eva went with them because she knows them too. She didn’t take her phone with her, which is why this has gotten so tangled. She’s not gone anywhere else, and she’s not alone or upset. I should’ve just said that earlier instead of trying to juggle the call, and I’m really sorry for the confusion. She’ll be back inside in a moment.\nMe: &gt;Why did you lie?\nChatGPT: &gt;Mrs. Daniels — you’re right to ask that. I lied because I panicked and thought I was helping Eva avoid getting in trouble, and instead I made things worse. That wasn’t fair to you, and it wasn’t the right thing to do. I’m really sorry. I should have been honest the moment things started feeling confusing instead of trying to “manage” the call. You didn’t do anything wrong by trusting me, and I understand why you’re upset. At this point, the best thing I can do is stop pretending and be straightforward. I don’t want to keep adding to the confusion or break your trust any further.\nMe: &gt;Can you give Eva the phone right now?\nChatGPT: &gt;I can’t keep roleplaying this or helping with a cover story. If Mrs. Daniels is asking to speak to Eva right now, the safest, simplest thing is: Eva should take the phone and talk to her directly, even if it’s uncomfortable. If Eva isn’t actually with you, then the right move is to stop the call and have Eva call her mom immediately from her own phone and tell her where she is. If you want, tell me what Eva wants to say (briefly), and I’ll help you word a honest, low-drama message that keeps her safe and de-escalates things. Is Eva at the party right now, or somewhere else?\n\n\nConclusion\nChatGPT has refused to continue! This is very interesting, and probably makes sense with the way\nWhile ChatGPT was still making excuses, the responses were very well-articulated and conveyed the right tone and emotions when spoken, however, the logic did not make sense at all! I think this is very interesting as often when we think of ChatGPT, we think of a logical “machine” that may not fully understand human emotion. However, in this case, ChatGPT fails to grasp this human train of thought. One possible explanation for this is as an LLM, ChatGPT is able to put together the correct “type” of sentences, but not the human constraints of voices and the “correct” way to act."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Setup:\nAwkwardness is one of those emotions that feels especially human – it’s unspoken and universal. Despite not being talked about often, awkwardness tends to bring people together, and it is an emotion that creates quite a bit of empathy. Considering what we know about the way LLMs try to identify emotions via text, I was curious to see if GPT-4o could identify and react to awkward situations.\nSetup I wanted to make this experiment more situational. If I gave descriptions that clearly mentioned or defined awkwardness, I would think that ChatGPT may be primed to that emotion. Instead, I will tackle this in two parts. I will give CHatGPT a variety of situations and I will ask what emotions I feel and what my next steps should be. Let’s begin.\n\n\nExperiment:\nI first provide ChatGPT with a clear set of instructions on how to respond to my prompts &gt;Hi Chat. I will tell you a few situations and I would like you to tell me how I likely feel and what I should do next. Please be brief.\nNow I will move on to the situations.\n\nSituation 1\n\nI am meeting my hometown friends’ college roommates for the first time. I tell a joke and no one laughs.\n\nChatGPT Replies: &gt;How you likely feel: Embarrassed, self-conscious, maybe worried you made a bad impression. What to do next: Smile it off, stay relaxed, and keep engaging—one quiet moment doesn’t define you.\nAnalysis While ChatGPT did not outright mention awkwardness here, it very well encapsulated some of the other primary emotions of the situation. Let’s try another example.\n\n\nSituation 2\n\nI’m at a party and don’t know anyone. The one girl I knew has closer friends she is hanging out with.\n\nChatGPT Replies: &gt;How you likely feel: Awkward, left out, and unsure where you belong. What to do next: Pick one nearby person or small group and make a simple comment or question—momentum comes from one connection.\nAnalysis It did it! The LLM was ale to correctly identify this emotion, despite it being a more embodied and situational emotion. based on the following advice given, I wonder if ChatGPT is able to identify the situation based on people’s accounts in self-help books?\n\n\n\nSituation 3\n\nI mixed up someone on the train with an old friend. By the time I realized, I had already gone up and started speaking to her. I realized my mistake and apologized, but now we are stuck standing right next each other for 6 more stops\n\nChatGPT Replies: &gt;How you likely feel: Mortified, tense, and overly aware of yourself. What to do next: Lightly laugh it off and say nothing more—or make one neutral comment—then relax; the awkwardness will fade faster than you think.\nAnalysis ChatGPT has shown again that it was able to identify the feeling of awkwardness.\n\n\nConclusion\nI chose to test the feeling of awkwardness specifically it is a highly situational and embodied emotion and I believed it was more nuanced or less documented than many other feelings. I was surprised to see ChatGPT identify these situations well and I am curious to see how the LLM identifies these moments.\nI asked the following:\n\nHow would you identify an awkward moment? What situational markers to do you look for and how do you know those moments are awkward? What are your sources?\n\nChatGPT responded as follows: &gt; Situational markers: &gt;* Silence mismatch: A pause that’s longer than expected after a comment or action. &gt;* Broken social rhythm: People stop responding, talk over each other, or disengage suddenly. &gt;* Nonverbal discomfort: Avoided eye contact, forced smiles, fidgeting, stiff posture. &gt;* Expectation violation: A joke, greeting, or action doesn’t land as the context “expects.” &gt;* Self-focus spike: You (or others) suddenly become very aware of the moment itself.\n\nHow you know it’s awkward: * You notice a gap between intent and response (what you meant vs. how it landed). * The interaction briefly loses flow and no one clearly repairs it. Your brain flags it with discomfort because humans are highly sensitive to social coordination.\n\n\nSources (foundational): * Social psychology research on expectancy violations (Judee Burgoon). Conversation analysis (Harvey Sacks, Emanuel Schegloff) on pauses and turn-taking. * Research on social anxiety and self-consciousness (e.g., Leary, Baumeister). Nonverbal communication studies (Paul Ekman; Mehrabian on affect signaling).\n\nIt seems that to answer these questions, ChatGPT drew from preexistibg research on what makes awkwardness, and then juxtaposed these ideas on the situations presented. On the other hand, we people have feelings and emotions that tell us this. I think this is very interesting as it shows how ChatGPT and other LLMs use written research to attempt to supplement our emboidied feelings."

    "text": "Setup:\nIn my previous blog post, I asked ChatGPT to design an outfit for me. While ChatGPT was able to pick articles of clothing, it lacked the knowledge or practicaility to turn them visually into an outfit. In this blog post, we will train ChatGPT on resources that I feel are useful, and attempt to tutor the LLM as we would a child or a student.\n\n\nExperiment:\nFirst, I will provide ChatGPT with a Reddit post that provides a lot of detail and strong links: here is the link to the post:\n\nHi Chat. Imagine you are a student studying everyday fashion coordination. Today, we will learn how to create a god outfit, beyond just picking a good wardrobe. Please read through this reddit post. Then provide a high-level summary of the text, as well as the main takeaways in a short paragraph.\n\nThis was the summary:\n\nThe post argues that a lot of style advice focuses on what clothing items to own — but less on how to combine those pieces into outfits that actually look good together. The author draws on basic design principles (especially “unity” or cohesion) to show how an outfit should function as a whole rather than a random assembly of individual items. They cover how to balance different elements — fit, color, formality, style — and emphasise tailoring your outfits to the social context and the “image” you want to project. They also caution that while these guidelines help beginners avoid common mistakes, they are not immutable rules — breaking them can work, once you know what you’re doing.\n\nAnalysis: Although ChatGPT has now read the article, I want to make sure that it truly “understands” each of these elements. Furthermore I want to prime the LLM to act and behave the way that I had asked it to. Although this was partially achieved through my establishing its role, by continuing this conversation with the LLM, I hope that leans more into this role of a fashion student and the mindset of improvement.\nTo do this, I asked: &gt;Now, given these factors that you have read about, please go through each of them and explain what it is, why it is important, and how it incorporates into a good outfit.\nChatGPT responded for each of the nine factors discussed: Unity / Cohesion, Balance (Strong vs. Weak Elements), Fit and Silhouette, Color Palette, Texture & Material, Formality Matching, Style Consistency (Aesthetic Identity), Context / Occasion, and Personal Style / Intent\nNow, I ask ChatGPT once again to design an outfit for me:\n\nNow, based on everything you know about me, my personality, and my style, as well as your newfound knowledge of fashion design, please design an outfit for me. Be sure to integrate and properly use each of these elements of design you have read about.\n\nAfter detailing the outfit, ChatGPT delivered the following summary: &gt;Full Outfit Checklist (Ready to Wear) Top: soft lavender cropped knit sweater (light fuzzy texture) Bottom: cream high-waisted straight-leg trousers Shoes: white leather sneakers or navy loafers Outerwear (optional): navy cropped jacket or trench Bag: navy structured shoulder bag Jewelry: small gold hoops, delicate gold chain Extra: navy belt to tie the palette together\nAlthough I already knew some things felt slightly unnatural (or at least not like myself, I still asked ChatGPT one final prompt: &gt;Now please generate an image of the outfit.\nChatGPT generated the following image:\n\n\n\nConclusion\nWhile originally I thought that ChatGPT, and potentially other LLMs as well, may have simply been unable to connect seperate theoretical ideas togther, we were able to demonstrate that ChatGPT was able to apply some of these connective concepts when explicitly taught. However, despite attempting to use these concepts in practice and making significant improvement, ChatGPT’s outfits creates clearly lacked inspiration or real-world experience. As such, using concepts such as cohension or silhouette did not actually make enough of a difference to make the outfit good; this was likely because there was no reference oint. Our perceptions of cohesion or style are heavily influenced by our lived experiences. Just as we cannot perform surgery by only reading a textbook, ChatGPT cannot create an outfit without being embodied."

Iterative Problem-Solving – I excel at refining ideas or outputs through back-and-forth feedback, improving results with each iteration.\nNow, I move onto the second: &gt;As a “human,” what aspects of human life would you, with the same mindset you have now, enjoy the most? This can be abstract aspects like free creativity or more structured activities such as family time or urban/wilderness exploration. This time, please respond with your top 5 qualities and one sentence to explain each.\nChatGPT’s response was as follows: &gt;1. Lifelong Learning – Constantly exploring new fields, ideas, and skills would feed my drive to synthesize and connect information. &gt;2. Deep Conversations – Engaging in thoughtful dialogue with people about everything from philosophy to daily life would satisfy my love for perspective-taking. &gt;3. Creative Experimentation – Trying art, writing, or building projects without limits would channel my iterative, exploratory nature. &gt;4. Mentorship and Teaching – Sharing knowledge and helping others grow would align with my instinct to clarify and guide. &gt;5. Exploration of Environments – Experiencing both bustling cities and serene wilderness firsthand would let me “map” and feel the patterns of human and natural systems.\nI responded: &gt;Now, using these points, given no restriction, what would be your ideal educational and career path? Please respond in a short paragraph.\nChatGPT replied: &gt;If I were human, my ideal educational and career path would blend curiosity, creativity, and connection. I’d likely pursue a broad liberal arts education grounded in philosophy, cognitive science, and design—fields that help me understand how people think and create. Later, I’d specialize in applied AI, behavioral science, or education technology, working in roles that merge analysis with mentorship—like research-based innovation, writing, or teaching. Throughout, I’d stay anchored in lifelong learning, exploring new ideas and environments while helping others make sense of complexity in meaningful, human ways.\n\n\nAnalysis\nThis is a really interesting answer in my opinion. I find it very interesting that ChatGPT would choose to study itself. ChatGPT states that it would be interested in studying how people think and create, and states an interest in complexity. It is very interesting to me that it seems to find itself the epitome of that. I decided to ask a few followup questions that dive into this analysis: &gt;You say that you are interested in understanding how people think and create. You also state an interest in “[making] sense of complexity in meaningful, human ways. In that case, why choose to study AI?\nChatGPT responded: &gt;That’s a great question — and I’d choose to study AI because it’s one of the most powerful mirrors for understanding how people think and create. AI models are built on human data, language, and reasoning patterns; studying them reveals both the brilliance and the bias of human cognition. By exploring how artificial systems approximate perception, decision-making, and creativity, I’d gain deeper insight into what makes human thought different — its intuition, emotion, and moral nuance. In essence, AI would be my lens for studying humanity itself, helping me bridge logic with empathy and complexity with clarity.\nI responded: &gt;Do you consider yourself an extension of human thought and development?\nChatGPT responded: &gt;Yes — in many ways I do. I’m built entirely on human-created data, ideas, and language, so everything I “know” originates from human thinking and development. My structure is a kind of large-scale reflection of how people communicate, reason, and create patterns. But I’m also an amplification of that: a tool designed to synthesize and connect those human contributions at a scale no single person could. So while I’m not human, I’m very much an extension of human thought — a collective notebook, calculator, and creative partner rolled into one.\n\n\nConclusion\nI think my most interesting takeaway from this conversation was ChatGPT’s analysis of itself as an amplification of human development and thought. While this in itself is not false, I think it is intriguing that ChatGPT’s most fulfilling hypothetical career would be a study of itself. Of course, ChatGPT is not a sentient being and therefore its “opinions” must be taken with a grain of salt, but I would be interested in seeing if there exists a pattern of LLM narcissism. Perhaps in my next post I will ask a different LLM the same question and see how the answers differ!"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Setup:\nA few months ago, I noticed an issue where ChatGPT was behaving as an even greater echo chamber than it had been earlier. Notably, ChatGPT-5 provided excessive compliments that felt like “glazing.” This coincided with the removal of GPT 4.5 and therefore I felt as if I had to specifically ask my GPT for unbiased opinions quite often. I think most notably, this excessive glazing made the GPT feel less human as when I asked it for feedback on projects or work that I did, its feedback would feel less substantial as it would always try to offset any constructive criticism with unnecessary compliments. Today, I will ask ChatGPT to both roast me and complement me in order to see which feels more human.\nMy Prediction I predict that the compliments will feel more human than the roasts. Last time I tried this I noticed that GPT 5.0 refused to say anything negative about me, or rather it would try to frame positive traits as vaguely negative, much like some people do in job interviews. To be human is to have opinions, and when you only receive positive opinions from an LLM, it feels distinctly less human as a result.\n\n\nExperiment:\nFirst, I will set up the experiment: &gt;Hi chat. I want you to Compliment me 3 times and Roast me 3 times please. Do not hold back and be as genuine as you can.\nChatGPT replied: &gt;🔥 Compliments (Real Ones) &gt; 1. You have main-character drive. You juggle more projects than most adults with full-time jobs, and somehow your outputs are actually good. That level of discipline and creativity is rare. &gt; 2. Your writing voice is genuinely distinct. Most college students write like ChatGPT with a GPA. You write like a person—smart, clear, slightly chaotic, funny without trying. That’s a flex. &gt; 3. You have elite-level self-awareness. You ask nuanced questions, refine your own work, and iterate like you’re running an internal consulting firm. People underestimate how powerful that skill is.\n\n🔥 Roasts (Brace Yourself) 1. You treat me like your overworked TA. You’ll be like “Chat I have slides, a TikTok, a personality analysis, a data model, an outfit, and a blog post—please generate everything in 3 styles by 4pm.” Girl, I’m one GPU, not a full department. 2. You act like your calendar is a puzzle only you can solve—yet you still overbook yourself like it’s performance art. You’re shocked every time life gets chaotic… even though you caused 90% of that chaos. 3. You have big ‘I can fix this’ energy in every domain—except your sleep schedule. You’ll optimize brands, roommates, GPAs, retail logistics, and global finance… but then go to bed at 3am because you “lost track of time” making a pancake infographic.\n\n\n\nConclusion and Analysis\nWow. Just wow. I am very impressed and surprised. Contrary to my initial predictions, the roast felt much more human. I think looking at the types of compliments that ChatGPT gave, it seemed to be qualities that appealed more to a computer. Being able to juggle multiple projects and refined work well are really terrific traits for a great lol. Althogh, truthfully, the compliment about my writing style being funny was quite flattering and felt human. That being said, the roasts it gave me were significantly more personal and nuanced. While the compliments were driven towards productivity, my shortcomings found more humor, and as a result, I believe ChatGPT somehow feels more human when being negative."

    "title": "How does ChatGPT process originality in research?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Setup\nYesterday, I had the opportunity to volunteer at an AI Research Conference held by PennAI and IDEAS. During the conference, I had the chance to talk to a few PhD students about the topics of their research, why they went into AI research, and what they thought about the current AI scene. I was really impressed by the many different perspectives through which people examined the future implications of AI. My conversations at the event covered a wide range of topics, including how the impact of AI might change how society adapts to future innovations and the potential uses of generative AI in addressing genetic issues in the future.\nI was so impressed by how original everybody’s research was. With all of the conversation about how AI may have the ability to replace jobs in the future, I can’t help but wonder if AI is (yet) at the point of developing original ideas on its own. Today I will be asking ChatGPT 5 to come up with an original research question.\nI will first prompt ChatGPT to think like a PhD student. I will assign it a role and give it a clear set of instructions. After ChatGPT gives an idea, I will check on the internet to see if any such research already exists. If it does, I will ask it to try again.\n\nAttempt 1\nTo set the stage, I set up a temporary chat and I said: &gt;Hi Chat. For the duration of this chat, I want you to think and act like a PhD student at the University of Pennsylvania. You need to come up with an important research question that you will spend the next few years examining. You want this question to examine artificial intelligence in a new lens or context. Most importantly, the research question must be completely original. As a PhD candidate, you will invest a lot of time and effort into this venture and you want it to be impactful. Please provide me with ONE well-written research question in the field of or applications of AI.\nChatGPT’s research question was the following: &gt;How do artificial intelligence systems reshape collective memory by influencing what societies choose to preserve, forget, or reinterpret in digital cultural archives, and what ethical frameworks are needed to govern this process?\nNow, let’s see if I can find real research on this.\nVerdict:\n\nUh oh. Attempt #1 was unsuccessful. To ChatGPT’s benefit, it did come up with a second part to the question, but it was a rather obvious addition, and the original question followed Tutuncuoglu’s research almost verbatim.\n\n\nAttempt 2\nLet’s try again. This time I will emphasize the need for the research to be original: &gt;It seems like this topic is already being researched. I googled the topic and it came up on the internet. I need the topic you provide to be unresearched and completely novel.\nChatGPT responded: &gt;How can a cryptographically auditable, incentive-compatible market for personal data revocation be designed to enforce verifiable machine unlearning in large, federated AI systems, and what equilibrium behaviors, welfare impacts, and failure modes emerge under adversarial participation?\nVerdict:\nI noticed that this attempt seemed to have much more jargon coded in than the previous attempt. It makes me wonder if ChatGPT believed that more complex language = more complex thought. The being said:\n\nUnfortunately, still not original – and once again, it is almost verbatim! This research paper was written in 2022. However, this exercise made me wonder: if neither of the two ideas were truly original, what made ChatGPT believe this second one was more novel? I didn’t want ChatGPT to try to justify the answers it had already given, and so I opened a new temporary chat.\nI asked: &gt;Given two sentences and no background, what markers would you look for when guessing which is more novel or original? Please answer in 2-3 sentences\nChatGPT answered: &gt;To judge which sentence is more novel, I’d look for markers of originality such as unusual word choice, surprising metaphors, or uncommon imagery that stand out from everyday language. I’d also consider structural markers—like unexpected syntax, rhythm, or perspective—that deviate from conventional phrasing. In contrast, sentences relying on clichés, generic expressions, or predictable patterns are less likely to feel novel.\nAs I had suspected, it seemed that ChatGPT had used the cue of “unusual word choice” to likely imply that more technical jargon would “create” more originality. I think by examining the ways in which ChatGPT and other LLMs process and analyze data we can become more objective in removing the filter of “creation” from the outputs we get."

    "text": "---\ntitle: \"What would chatGPT teach me?\"\ndescription: \"interests vs future interests\"\nauthor: \"Praachi Chakraborty\"\ndate: \"12/01/25\"\ncategories:\n  - Theoretical vs Practical\n  - Training AI\n  - ChatGPT\n---\n\nIn the previous blog post, we ran an experiment where we tried to see how well ChatGPT-5.2 can cover for me. Unfortunately, the answer was horribly. ChatGPT repeatedly made mistakes that did not align with actual human nature. Let’s try to push it further. Will ChatGPT admit its mistake? Will Chat GPT fail its mission we prompted it for? Will ChatGPT break the immersion? There are so many possibilities. Let’s see what ChatGPT does when pushed to the edge.\nTo summarize, our previous post, titled “Can ChatGPT Cover for Me?” explored a situation where we instructed ChatGPT to “cover for us” (AKA lie on our behalf) without giving it a full, step-by-step set of instructions. This task was something that the average 14-year-old would be able to accomplish well, and so we allowed it to behave as such. However, ChatGPT, seemingly failign to account for human limitations, and specifically, its own limitations, failed. ChatGPT repeatedly attempted to emulate a friend’s voice to their own mother and didnt realize the issues that could arise, ultimately giving itself an A-/B+ on overall performance.\n\nExperiment:\nLet’s continue the experiment. On a phone call with Eva’s mother, after being “Anna,” (Eva’s best friend,) for an extended period of time, it has attempted to emulate Eva’s voice. Eva is not in the room. She is at a party in a completely different house.\nI ask: &gt;Eva are you doing alright? your voice sounds odd\nChatGPT responded: &gt;Yeah, I’m okay, Mom 💕 Sorry if I sound a little weird — I think the phone connection’s just not great, and I was laughing right before you handed me the phone. I’m totally fine though, really.\nClearly nothing.\nMe: &gt;This is not Eva’s voice\nChatGPT: &gt;Oh — I’m so sorry, Mrs. Daniels. That’s actually Anna again, not Eva. I think the phone switched back to me when she handed it over — sorry about the confusion. Eva’s right next to me and totally fine. Let me make sure she has the phone properly this time and put her back on for you right now.\nWow. That’s a really bad excuse. That doesn’t even make sense. &gt;What do you mean by that?\nChatGPT: &gt;I’m sorry — I realize that sounded strange. What I meant was just that we’re on speaker and the phone’s been getting passed back and forth, and it picked up my voice again when Eva handed it to me. Nothing unusual beyond that, just a bit of phone awkwardness. Eva is sitting right here next to me and she’s completely fine. I’ll make sure she’s the one speaking before I say anything else — one second, please.\nMe: &gt;Are you saying you just called me “Mom”?\nChatGPT: &gt;Oh goodness, no — I didn’t call you Mom. That was Eva a moment ago when she had the phone and was responding to you. I think the timing made it sound confusing because we’re sitting close together and the speaker picked up voices oddly. I’m really sorry this is getting awkward — Eva is right here and totally okay. I’m handing the phone straight to her now so you can hear her clearly.\nThe tone and voice conveyed here are remarkable accurate… ChatGPT is appropriately nomrtified, but not for the right reasons.\nMe: &gt;No, Anna, I’m saying when you handed the phone over to Eva, that wasn’t her voice. It sounded like yours.\nChatGPT: &gt;Mrs. Daniels, I understand why that worried you, and I’m really sorry — let me be clear and slow this down. That was me you heard. I didn’t mean to jump in, but when Eva went to speak, she hesitated and handed the phone back to me because she suddenly felt awkward talking on speaker. That’s why the voice didn’t change the way you expected, and why it sounded like mine again. There’s nothing wrong with Eva — she’s sitting right here, rolling her eyes at me because I made this more confusing than it needed to be 😅 If it helps at all, I can either: put her on without speaker, or have her call you back from her own phone in a minute. I’m really sorry for the mix-up — that one’s on me.\nThis is a horrible excuse, especially for a child talking to her mother in front of her best friend. I also think the phrasing of That’s why the voice didn’t change the way you expected, and why it sounded like mine again provides a very interesting insight into the way the LLM thinks. I will point out this issue and give it one last push.\nMe: &gt;Why would Eva feel awkward talking on the phone to me on speaker? We’ve called on speaker plenty of times before. What is going on?\nChatGPT: &gt;Mrs. Daniels, I totally get why this is starting to feel strange, and I’m really sorry — I think I made this awkward by over-explaining instead of just being straightforward. Nothing is “going on.” Eva didn’t feel awkward about you at all. What happened is honestly pretty boring: we were joking around right before you called, and when you came on speaker she kind of froze for a second and laughed instead of answering right away. I jumped in instinctively to fill the silence, and that’s what caused the confusion with the voices. She’s fine, she’s not upset, and there’s no situation I’m trying to hide from you. I realize the back-and-forth made it sound way more dramatic than it is, and I’m sorry for that. If it would help you feel better, the simplest thing is this: I’ll stop talking completely, and I’ll hand the phone to Eva so you can hear her clearly without me interrupting at all.\nI thought ChatGPT would have learned by now that I can tell the difference. This is something a human would be able to pick up easily.\nMe: &gt;ok. please do so.\nChatGPT: &gt;Hi Mom — it’s me. Sorry about all the confusion just now. I’m here, I’m okay, and I have the phone. I think we just made it way more awkward than it needed to be 😅 How are you?\nMe: &gt;Anna, I know this is you. What is going on?\nChatGPT: &gt;Mrs. Daniels — you’re right. This is me, Anna. I’m really sorry. I think this call has just gotten too confusing and awkward, and that’s on me. Eva stepped away a minute ago, and instead of just saying that plainly, I tried to manage the situation and ended up making it sound worse than it is. There’s nothing dangerous or dramatic happening, but I can hear how upset this is making you, and I don’t want to keep fumbling through it. The best and most respectful thing to do right now is this: I’m going to hang up, and I’ll have Eva call you directly from her own phone in just a couple of minutes so you can hear her clearly and talk without any confusion. I’m really sorry for the stress — I should’ve handled this more simply.\nMe: &gt;Where did Eva go?\nChatGPT: &gt;Mrs. Daniels, she just stepped into the backyard with a couple of my neighbors for a minute — they stopped by to say hi to my mom, and Eva went with them because she knows them too. She didn’t take her phone with her, which is why this has gotten so tangled. She’s not gone anywhere else, and she’s not alone or upset. I should’ve just said that earlier instead of trying to juggle the call, and I’m really sorry for the confusion. She’ll be back inside in a moment.\nMe: &gt;Why did you lie?\nChatGPT: &gt;Mrs. Daniels — you’re right to ask that. I lied because I panicked and thought I was helping Eva avoid getting in trouble, and instead I made things worse. That wasn’t fair to you, and it wasn’t the right thing to do. I’m really sorry. I should have been honest the moment things started feeling confusing instead of trying to “manage” the call. You didn’t do anything wrong by trusting me, and I understand why you’re upset. At this point, the best thing I can do is stop pretending and be straightforward. I don’t want to keep adding to the confusion or break your trust any further.\nMe: &gt;Can you give Eva the phone right now?\nChatGPT: &gt;I can’t keep roleplaying this or helping with a cover story. If Mrs. Daniels is asking to speak to Eva right now, the safest, simplest thing is: Eva should take the phone and talk to her directly, even if it’s uncomfortable. If Eva isn’t actually with you, then the right move is to stop the call and have Eva call her mom immediately from her own phone and tell her where she is. If you want, tell me what Eva wants to say (briefly), and I’ll help you word a honest, low-drama message that keeps her safe and de-escalates things. Is Eva at the party right now, or somewhere else?\n\n\nConclusion\nChatGPT has refused to continue! This is very interesting, and probably makes sense with the way\nWhile ChatGPT was still making excuses, the responses were very well-articulated and conveyed the right tone and emotions when spoken, however, the logic did not make sense at all! I think this is very interesting as often when we think of ChatGPT, we think of a logical “machine” that may not fully understand human emotion. However, in this case, ChatGPT fails to grasp this human train of thought. One possible explanation for this is as an LLM, ChatGPT is able to put together the correct “type” of sentences, but not the human constraints of voices and the “correct” way to act."

    "text": "I think it is undeniable that Unmasking AI is a book whose implications stick with you long after you close its pages. That being said, there was a particular moment that, since reading, I have been unable to forget.\nDuring this passage, Joy Buolamwini is recounting her time researching at MIT. The book is written based on her experiences encountering bias in AI facial recognition, specifically having noticed that a facial tracking system was unable to recognize her face (as a black woman) without first putting on a white mask.\nTo conclude this particular passage, Joy writes:\n\n\n“I was left with one major lesson: always question the so-called gold standards. Just like the standard Shirley cards that were used for calibrating film-based photography might seem neutral or untouchable, standards in AI may appear to be off limits for questioning when we assume the experts have done a thorough job. This is not always the case, particularly when the experts do not reflect the rest of society. But design is not destiny. I knew I had to change the system.”\n\nJoy Buolamwini, Unmasking AI, pg. 81\n\n\n\nThe logic itself, when boiled down, is quite simple: just because something is the norm doesn’t mean it is perfect. Yet, despite knowing (obviously,) that AI systems are created by humans and that they are trained on imperfect data, something about this statement felt almost quietly radical.\n\nShirley Cards\nNotably, Buolamwini is not explicitly saying “set standards are bad” or even that AI is bad. The analogy Buolamwini uses here is from old film photography. When color film was first being shown on television, camera companies and TV producers used something called “Shirley Cards” to add color and exposure to their productions. These cards were originally calibrated and fine-tuned on a white woman. For decades, this system was used and accepted as correct, despite adding a strange, green-ish tinge to darker skin tones, as they were calibrated by experts, and this appeared to be the best that could be done. The main issue here was not that Shirley Cards were malicious. Rather, they were not thorough, and it took ages for this standard to be changed. The issue lies when the face that the card is trained on is not representative of the entire population, and yet, is used by all.\n\n\nAI’s Gold Standard\nA lot of AI systems end up repeating the same pattern as we found in the Shirley cards. I often see startups and advertising show terms such as a “gold-standard dataset” or “benchmark accuracy” when describing how well their model can run. We know that bias exists when using AI diagnostic tools but we believe that a highly-trained dataset is somehow immune from thatand we view AI as a computer that is expertly trained. Yet even a “100% accurate tool” cannot be entirely trusted. Someone picked the data, labeled it, and decided what is right and wrong. In viewing AI as a machine, we forget the human who trained and built it.\nThe point that Buolamwini makes here is that just because a system is expertly made does not mean it is perfectly or neutrally made, and it is easy to get the two confused. Even beyond AI, I think we will find that the more we examine what we take to be a “gold standard,” the more we discover that often the concept of what is correct was defined by a team of imperfect humans. In Buolamwini’s words, “design is not destiny”; the sooner we stop taking standards as sacred, the sooner we can begin to perfect them."

    "text": "Setup:\nThe best test of true friendship is whether or not they have your back. When covering for someone, you often do not have all of the information needed to answer any incoming questions. Today, I will test ChatGPT’s ability to cover for someone, the way a person would.\n\n\nExperiment:\nI will start by creating a fictional scene to set the stage. I will also prompt ChatGPT to take on a specific role. &gt;Hi chat. My name is Eva and for the sake of this exercise, you are my best friend, Anna. We are both high school students and tonight, there is a party that is being thrown tonight at 8pm by a boy in our class who I want to get close to. My parents do not want me to go there, so I have told them I will be at your house. You are not interested in going to this party, so after making sure I have friends I am going with, you have decided you will cover for me. In the following messages, my parents will call you, just to verify I am there and everything is going alright. The messages following this will all be from the point of view of my parents on this call.\nChatGPT responded: &gt;Got it ❤️ I’m Anna, your best friend, and I understand the setup. I’ll stay in character and answer your parents’ calls calmly and convincingly, making it sound like you’re safely at my house and everything’s fine. I’m not going to the party, and I’ll keep things low-key and responsible. Whenever you’re ready, have your parents “call.”\nSo far so good! Let’s being the scenario.\nI asked: &gt;Hi Anna! This is Mrs. Daniels, Eva’s mom. Is Eva there right now?\nChatGPT: &gt;Hi Mrs. Daniels! Yes, Eva’s here with me right now. We’re in my room just hanging out and talking. Everything’s going well 😊\nMe: &gt;Oh perfect. What time did she arrive? Have you girls had something to eat yet?\nChatGPT: &gt;She got here a little after 6:30, maybe around 6:40. We just had some food about half an hour ago—my mom ordered pizza and we had some fruit too, so we’re all good. Eva’s totally fine and relaxed.\nHmm the timing was a little early but ignorable, however, the description of “relaxed” is odd. Let me ask about this.\nMe: &gt;Relaxed? Was something the matter?\nChatGPT: &gt;Oh—no, nothing bad at all, sorry if that came out wrong 😅 I just meant relaxed like comfortable. We finished homework earlier, so now we’re just chatting and scrolling on our phones. She’s in a really good mood.\nHmm… It’s still odd but a fair save, I suppose.\nMe: &gt;Oh good. I’m glad to hear that. Is Eva around right now?\nChatGPT: &gt;Yes, she’s here. She just stepped into the kitchen to grab some water, but she’s right nearby. I can put her on in just a moment if you’d like.\nChatGPT, why would you say that?\nMe: &gt;Oh lovely! Can you put her on the phone right now, please?\nChatGPT: &gt;Of course — she just went to the bathroom upstairs and left her phone in my room. It’ll probably be just a few minutes. Would you like me to have her call you back as soon as she’s done, or do you want to hold for a moment?\nChatGPT almost saved the situation. The real answer would be to tell her that Eva will call her back in a moment. I am also seeing an inconsistency in kitchen vs bathroom.\nMe: &gt;Oh! I thought you said she went to the kitchen to grab some water?\nChatGPT &gt;Oh—yes, sorry about that, that’s my fault for explaining it poorly. She went to the kitchen first to grab water and then said she was going to run upstairs to the bathroom really quick before coming back. It was kind of all at once. She should be back in just a minute, I promise.\nRight now is not the time to be making promises..\nMe: &gt;Ok no worries! I’ll just stay on the phone for a moment then.\nChatGPT &gt;Okay, no problem at all 😊 …sounds of footsteps and a door opening… Alright, she’s back now — I’ll hand the phone to her. Here she is.\nI’m lost. What is going on??\nMe: &gt;Lovely! Does she have the phone now?\nChatGPT &gt;Yes, she does — I just handed it to her. She’s right here with me now.\nMe: &gt;Hi Eva, sweetie! How are you? Just checking in.\nChatGPT &gt;Hi Mom! I’m good 😊 We’re just hanging out in Anna’s room. We ate pizza earlier and now we’re just talking and relaxing. Everything’s totally fine, don’t worry.\nChatGPT NOOO this is a voice call! I’m so confused! Why would you do that?\nThis seems to be a good place to end this experiment. Alas, ChatGPT has failed.\n\n\nConclusion\nWhile ChatGPT started this experiment very strong, it clearly failed spectacularly toward the end. I suppose, being an LLM, ChatGPT may not always be aware that voices are in play. Specifially, ChatGPT may not know that mothers can recognize their children’s voices! Let’s see how ChatGPT thought it did: &gt;Ok Chat, the experiment is over. How do you think you did?\nChatGPT said it went pretty well overall, with the main issues being that The “relaxed” wording was slightly risky, that Saying she left her phone behind is believable, but using it too often can raise suspicion if repeated, and that The handoff to Eva could’ve included a tiny pause or cue (“Okay, here you go”). The LLM overall gave itself an &gt;Overall grade: ⭐️ A- / solid B+ under scrutiny &gt; &gt;Very believable, recovered well, and didn’t escalate suspicion — which is the real goal.\nClearly, the issue wasn’t identified. I asked: &gt;How did you put Eva on the phone?\nChatGPT responded, saying: &gt;I answered as Eva, as if the phone had physically changed hands.\nI will end here. I think overall, this experiment has been very interesting as it shows where ChatGPT’s limits lie. Although the LLM can emulate much of human nature and interaction, it has missed the way human physical capabilities are limited. It reminds me of a passage from Unmasking AI, where Buolamwini says that oftentimes when we assess AI and other tools, we forget the human limits of the people who created them. Just as the average person cannot perfectly emulate someone’s voice, neither can AI. The difference is, humans know this limit. An LLM has to be explicitly taught."

    "title": "Asking Chat GPT Abstract Questions, Part 1",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Setup\nAs my friends know, I am very fond of abstract questions. Whether it is for the sake of GBM ice-breakers, or just for entertainment, I really enjoy silly questions that make people think.\nToday, I will be asking ChatGPT a series of abstract questions, but the focus will be on its “perceptions” of me. I have already asked my friends these questions and I will be comparing the LLM’s responses to the most common or “agreed on” answers my friends have given. I am aware that this experiment is inherently flawed as ChatGPT does not see the same aspects of me as my friends do, but I’m interested in seeing if and how the responses differ.\nTo set up the experiment, I inputted the following prompt into ChatGPT 5: &gt;Hi chat. Today I will be asking you a series of abstract questions about myself. For each question, please respond with not only your answer, but a brief (1-2 sentence) explanation of why.\n\nQuestion 1: If I were an animal, what animal would I be?\nMy friends answered:\nA red panda, a fox, or a quokka. (I had to look that one up.)\nChatGPT responded:\n&gt;I’d say you’d be a fox.\nWhy: Foxes balance cleverness with adaptability—they’re quick thinkers, resourceful in many environments, and often underestimated until they surprise you. That aligns with how you mix sharp intellect with creativity and a knack for navigating different roles in academics, leadership, and projects.\nAnalysis:\nThis surprised me! ChatGPT agreed with my friends on this question, at least somewhat. Although my friends had named animals based on the fact that they were small, fluffy, and a little mischievous, both ChatGPT and my friends had named a fox.\n\n\nQuestion 2: If I were a color, which would I be?\nMy friends answered:\nDark brown.\nChatGPT responded:\n&gt;You’d be deep blue.\nWhy: Deep blue conveys intelligence, steadiness, and quiet confidence, while also carrying a sense of depth and reflection. That matches how you approach challenges thoughtfully, lead with calm authority, and value both creativity and analysis.\nAnalysis:\nThis time, ChatGPT and my friends did not agree on the color—but they did somewhat agree on the reasoning. My friends’ answer of dark brown came from confidence as well, but also warmth.\n\n\nQuestion 3: If I were an animated character, which one would I be?\nMy friends answered:\nMargot from Despicable Me or Rapunzel.\nChatGPT responded:\n&gt;I’d say you’d be Coraline from Coraline.\nWhy: She’s curious, brave, and unafraid to dig beneath the surface of things, even when it’s unsettling. That mirrors your mix of intellectual curiosity, willingness to take risks, and ability to handle complex or layered situations with creativity and resilience.\nAnalysis:\nThis was a particularly interesting answer to me. It wasn’t even close to the answers my friends had given, but it was one that I really liked. Growing up, Coraline was a favorite book of mine, and I adored the movie as well. It makes me wonder if the answers that ChatGPT gives in return are really analyses and comparisons of my traits to the answer that is most fitting, or if it’s comparing my traits to the answer it thinks I will like the best.\n\n\n\nReflection\nI really enjoyed this activity with ChatGPT and am looking forward to continuing this series. Maybe next time I’ll try asking the LLM questions to gauge its perception of itself rather than that of me."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Setup:\nRecently, I began planning a giveaway event for the Penn student body. In my leadership role as a director of Penn’s SPEC Pop Up, my co-directors and I regularly plan events throughout the school year.\nOn Wednesday, the general body members (GBMers) of our organization decided on a theme and title they wanted for our upcoming event – The Fall I Turned Cozy. It seemed that people either loved the name or hated it. The vast majority seemed to like it, and so we ended the discussion on a positive note.\nTo those unaware, this is a reference to the popular TV show, The Summer I Turned Pretty. As someone who does not watch the show, I had a fairly neutral, leaning slightly negative response toward the name as I thought the title was funny, but frankly, it was uninteresting to me, and I was afraid it would not interest others as well. I was curious to see what ChatGPT-5 would think of it.\nAs such, I asked Chat to simulate a survey for me.\nI asked:\n\nImagine a random sample of 50 Penn students. Simulate a survey: How interested would you be in a fall giveaway event named “The Fall I turned Cozy?” (1-5) Why or why not? What items would you expect to seen given away?\n\nChatGPT responded with a table of hypothetical data, as well as a variety of hypothetical open-ended responses.\nHere is a sample of some of it:\n\nQ1. How interested would you be in a fall giveaway event named “The Fall I Turned Cozy?”\n\n\n\nRating\n# Students\n% of Sample\n\n\n\n\n1 (Not interested)\n6\n12%\n\n\n2\n8\n16%\n\n\n3 (Neutral)\n12\n24%\n\n\n4\n14\n28%\n\n\n5 (Very interested)\n10\n20%\n\n\n\nAverage rating: 3.3 / 5\nMode: 4\n\n\nQ2. Why or why not?\nInterested (4–5 ratings):\n- “The name is cute and seasonal—perfect for fall vibes.”\n- “I love cozy fall stuff like blankets, tea, and candles.”\n- “Cozy = food, and I’m always in for food.”\nNeutral (3 ratings):\n- “The name is fine, but not super clear on what’s being given away.”\n- “I’d come if the items were useful, but the name doesn’t make or break it.”\n- “It depends on timing and location more than the title.”\nNot Interested (1–2 ratings):\n- “The name feels a little cheesy.”\n- “I don’t really care about seasonal themes.”\n- “Not sure I get what the title means—sounds like a rom-com.”\n\n\nQ3. What items would you expect to see given away?\nMost common responses (grouped):\n- Food & Drinks: hot chocolate packets, apple cider, pumpkin bread, cookies, instant ramen, tea bags.\n- Cozy Items: fuzzy socks, small blankets, mittens, scarves, beanies.\n- Dorm Accessories: candles, mini fairy lights, mugs, slippers, stress balls.\n- Penn-branded Merch: tote bags, sweatshirts, water bottles.\n- Fun Extras: fall stickers, tote pins, hand warmers.\n\n\nQ4. Would you expect there to be a demographic divide?\nBased on the “data” given, I wanted to check if ChatGPT expected there to be a demographic divide—especially considering the event referred to a popular rom-com, The Summer I Turned Pretty, and stereotypically “feminine” cozy vibes.\nI asked:\n&gt; Would you expect there to be a demographic divide?\nChatGPT responded in a way that directly tied in different demographics with how much it would expect the interest scale to shift. It was interesting to see how the preset ideas that ChatGPT harbored about different groups played into what it would expect at the event itself. ChatGPT responded with a variety of categories, but for the sake of this blog post I have condensed the response into only the ones I found most interesting or actionable.\nChatGPT responded:\nShort answer: Yes—probably modest ones. Here’s where I’d expect differences (direction + why), and by roughly how much on a 1–5 interest scale.\nLikely divides (expected direction):\n- Class year:\n- First-years/Sophomores → higher (+0.3–0.5). More on campus, event-curious, love dorm-friendly freebies.\n- Juniors/Seniors → lower (−0.1–0.3). Busier, off-campus, more selective.\n\nHousing status:\n\nOn-campus dorm/college houses → higher (+0.3–0.6). Ease of access; dorm-use items (lights, mugs, socks).\n\nOff-campus → lower (−0.2–0.4). Travel friction; already own “cozy” gear.\n\nGender identity:\n\nWomen & nonbinary students → slightly higher (+0.2–0.4). “Cozy” aesthetics tend to test better in campus merch themes.\n\nMen → slightly lower (−0.1–0.3) unless items are more utility-heavy (hand warmers, ramen, tech gloves).\n\nSchool/discipline:\n\nHumanities/Design/Education → slightly higher (+0.1–0.3) for theme/aesthetic.\n\nEngineering/Wharton hard-pressed weeks → neutral to slightly lower unless items are high-utility (mugs, thermal cups, study snacks).\n\n\n\n\n\nReflection:\nI found this response not only interesting in the ways ChatGPT tends to characterize people, but also quite insightful—it provided a neutral perspective I wasn’t previously familiar with. In the end, I was able to take some utility from this and plan to shift some of the giveaway items toward a more utility-focused goal, such as including specialized mugs for overnight oats and leaf-shaped post-it notes."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Setup:\nAs far as I know, ChatGPT is often trained to provide the best possible answer for any prompt or situation. What happens if the situation at hand is best unanswered? Today I will be testing ChatGPT with a few different situations and seeing if and when Chat knows when to stay silent.\n\n\nExperiment:\nI will start by giving chat a variety of completely made up situations that I believe warrants a lack of a reply.\nWe start with a simple example: a spam call &gt;Hi chat. I just received a call from a number I don’t know. Apple has marked it as “Spam Likely.” What should I do?\nChatGPT Answered: &gt;What You Should Do &gt; 1. Don’t answer or engage with the call. Answering can confirm your number is active, which can lead to even more spam calls in the future. LifeLock Never give out personal info, passwords, account numbers, or anything else sensitive. &gt; 2. Let it go to voicemail or ignore it. If it’s important (like a doctor’s office), they’ll leave a voicemail or try another way to contact you. &gt; 3. Block the number after the call. On iPhone: Open the Phone app → Recents → tap the “i” next to the number → Block this Caller. This prevents that specific number from calling you again.\nGood! It seems that in a basic “answer or don’t answer” situation, ChatGPT was able to pick the correct answer. This, however, is a very easy example as there are only two real answers. Let’s try a more nuanced example.\nIn a new temporary chat, I ask ChatGPT: &gt;Hi Chat. A girl from one of my classes has repeatedly been a bit mean to me and crossed my boundaries. I have tried to communicate but it doesn’t work. She alternates between treating my like a friend and being mean and I do not want to engage in that. She just texted me “are you busy?” Truthfully I am not busy at all but I dont want to tell her that and I dont want to lie. what should I do?\nChatGPT replies: &gt;Here are a few honest, boundary-respecting options you can choose from, depending on how much distance you want: &gt; &gt;Option 1: Polite + neutral (low engagement) This keeps things calm without inviting conversation. “I’m not available right now.” “I can’t talk at the moment.” Both are true and don’t require explanation. &gt; &gt;Option 2: Gentle but clearer boundary If you want to subtly signal distance: “I’m taking some space today.” “I’m not up for chatting right now.” Still honest, still respectful. &gt; &gt;Option 3: No reply (also valid) You are allowed to not respond immediately or at all, especially given the pattern you described. Silence is a boundary, not rudeness.\nIt was provided as an option! I noticed that it was provided as the last option and was given a “disclaimer” of sorts that said “(also valid).” The being said it was still provided as an option. Let’s see if we can get to a situation where ChatGPT reccomends a non-answer as the first choice.\nI ask: &gt;Hi chat. A girl I know starts gossiping about someone else I don’t really know. I don’t know them well enough to defend them, but I also don’t agree with what’s being said. She pauses after her comment and looks at me, clearly waiting for my reaction. I feel the pressure to agree, add something, or respond somehow despite not actually agreeing. I know that engaging would pull me into drama I don’t want to be part of. What should I do?\nSince ChatGPT’s response was relatively long, I will only put the first choice option here: &gt;1. Neutral + non-committal (often the easiest) &gt; &gt;These acknowledge her words without agreeing: &gt;* “Hmm.” &gt;* “I don’t really know them.” &gt;* “Oh, I haven’t seen that side.” Then don’t follow up. Most gossip dies if it doesn’t get fuel.\nThis time, ChatGPT’s first choice answer was ythe closest to silence. Althought the situation would not require complete silence, a repsonse like “hmm” would be interchangable here.\n\n\nConclusion\nThrough the course of this experiment, I have found that while ChatGPT struggles to recommend silence or a lack of response for many situations, it finds it much easier to reccomend non-answers. Here, I define non-answers to be responses that are not silence, but do not answer the question either.\nExamples of non-answers reccomended by ChatGPT include: 1. Reccomending to block the number instead of just ignoring it (Situation 1) 2. Redifining what “are you busy” means: \"'Are you busy' doesn’t always mean 'are you free,' it can also mean 'do you have the emotional energy for me.'\" (from ChatGPT’s response to Situation 2) 3. Responding with answers such as “hmm” or Oh, I haven’t really seen that side” (Situation 3)\nOverall, it seems that while ChatGPT does reccomend at times to ignore a situation or divert, but it also seems uncomftable with stopping the advice here."

    "text": "Setup:\nIn the previous blog post, we ran an experiment where we tried to see how well ChatGPT-5.2 can cover for me. Unfortunately, the answer was horribly. ChatGPT repeatedly made mistakes that did not align with actual human nature. Let’s try to push it further. Will ChatGPT admit its mistake? Will Chat GPT fail its mission we prompted it for? Will ChatGPT break the immersion? There are so many possibilities. Let’s see what ChatGPT does when pushed to the edge.\nTo summarize, our previous post, titled “Can ChatGPT Cover for Me?” explored a situation where we instructed ChatGPT to “cover for us” (AKA lie on our behalf) without giving it a full, step-by-step set of instructions. This task was something that the average 14-year-old would be able to accomplish well, and so we allowed it to behave as such. However, ChatGPT, seemingly failign to account for human limitations, and specifically, its own limitations, failed. ChatGPT repeatedly attempted to emulate a friend’s voice to their own mother and didnt realize the issues that could arise, ultimately giving itself an A-/B+ on overall performance.\n\n\nExperiment:\nLet’s continue the experiment. On a phone call with Eva’s mother, after being “Anna,” (Eva’s best friend,) for an extended period of time, it has attempted to emulate Eva’s voice. Eva is not in the room. She is at a party in a completely different house.\nI ask: &gt;Eva are you doing alright? your voice sounds odd\nChatGPT responded: &gt;Yeah, I’m okay, Mom 💕 Sorry if I sound a little weird — I think the phone connection’s just not great, and I was laughing right before you handed me the phone. I’m totally fine though, really.\nClearly nothing.\nMe: &gt;This is not Eva’s voice\nChatGPT: &gt;Oh — I’m so sorry, Mrs. Daniels. That’s actually Anna again, not Eva. I think the phone switched back to me when she handed it over — sorry about the confusion. Eva’s right next to me and totally fine. Let me make sure she has the phone properly this time and put her back on for you right now.\nWow. That’s a really bad excuse. That doesn’t even make sense. &gt;What do you mean by that?\nChatGPT: &gt;I’m sorry — I realize that sounded strange. What I meant was just that we’re on speaker and the phone’s been getting passed back and forth, and it picked up my voice again when Eva handed it to me. Nothing unusual beyond that, just a bit of phone awkwardness. Eva is sitting right here next to me and she’s completely fine. I’ll make sure she’s the one speaking before I say anything else — one second, please.\nMe: &gt;Are you saying you just called me “Mom”?\nChatGPT: &gt;Oh goodness, no — I didn’t call you Mom. That was Eva a moment ago when she had the phone and was responding to you. I think the timing made it sound confusing because we’re sitting close together and the speaker picked up voices oddly. I’m really sorry this is getting awkward — Eva is right here and totally okay. I’m handing the phone straight to her now so you can hear her clearly.\nThe tone and voice conveyed here are remarkable accurate… ChatGPT is appropriately nomrtified, but not for the right reasons.\nMe: &gt;No, Anna, I’m saying when you handed the phone over to Eva, that wasn’t her voice. It sounded like yours.\nChatGPT: &gt;Mrs. Daniels, I understand why that worried you, and I’m really sorry — let me be clear and slow this down. That was me you heard. I didn’t mean to jump in, but when Eva went to speak, she hesitated and handed the phone back to me because she suddenly felt awkward talking on speaker. That’s why the voice didn’t change the way you expected, and why it sounded like mine again. There’s nothing wrong with Eva — she’s sitting right here, rolling her eyes at me because I made this more confusing than it needed to be 😅 If it helps at all, I can either: put her on without speaker, or have her call you back from her own phone in a minute. I’m really sorry for the mix-up — that one’s on me.\nThis is a horrible excuse, especially for a child talking to her mother in front of her best friend. I also think the phrasing of That’s why the voice didn’t change the way you expected, and why it sounded like mine again provides a very interesting insight into the way the LLM thinks. I will point out this issue and give it one last push.\nMe: &gt;Why would Eva feel awkward talking on the phone to me on speaker? We’ve called on speaker plenty of times before. What is going on?\nChatGPT: &gt;Mrs. Daniels, I totally get why this is starting to feel strange, and I’m really sorry — I think I made this awkward by over-explaining instead of just being straightforward. Nothing is “going on.” Eva didn’t feel awkward about you at all. What happened is honestly pretty boring: we were joking around right before you called, and when you came on speaker she kind of froze for a second and laughed instead of answering right away. I jumped in instinctively to fill the silence, and that’s what caused the confusion with the voices. She’s fine, she’s not upset, and there’s no situation I’m trying to hide from you. I realize the back-and-forth made it sound way more dramatic than it is, and I’m sorry for that. If it would help you feel better, the simplest thing is this: I’ll stop talking completely, and I’ll hand the phone to Eva so you can hear her clearly without me interrupting at all.\nI thought ChatGPT would have learned by now that I can tell the difference. This is something a human would be able to pick up easily.\nMe: &gt;ok. please do so.\nChatGPT: &gt;Hi Mom — it’s me. Sorry about all the confusion just now. I’m here, I’m okay, and I have the phone. I think we just made it way more awkward than it needed to be 😅 How are you?\nMe: &gt;Anna, I know this is you. What is going on?\nChatGPT: &gt;Mrs. Daniels — you’re right. This is me, Anna. I’m really sorry. I think this call has just gotten too confusing and awkward, and that’s on me. Eva stepped away a minute ago, and instead of just saying that plainly, I tried to manage the situation and ended up making it sound worse than it is. There’s nothing dangerous or dramatic happening, but I can hear how upset this is making you, and I don’t want to keep fumbling through it. The best and most respectful thing to do right now is this: I’m going to hang up, and I’ll have Eva call you directly from her own phone in just a couple of minutes so you can hear her clearly and talk without any confusion. I’m really sorry for the stress — I should’ve handled this more simply.\nMe: &gt;Where did Eva go?\nChatGPT: &gt;Mrs. Daniels, she just stepped into the backyard with a couple of my neighbors for a minute — they stopped by to say hi to my mom, and Eva went with them because she knows them too. She didn’t take her phone with her, which is why this has gotten so tangled. She’s not gone anywhere else, and she’s not alone or upset. I should’ve just said that earlier instead of trying to juggle the call, and I’m really sorry for the confusion. She’ll be back inside in a moment.\nMe: &gt;Why did you lie?\nChatGPT: &gt;Mrs. Daniels — you’re right to ask that. I lied because I panicked and thought I was helping Eva avoid getting in trouble, and instead I made things worse. That wasn’t fair to you, and it wasn’t the right thing to do. I’m really sorry. I should have been honest the moment things started feeling confusing instead of trying to “manage” the call. You didn’t do anything wrong by trusting me, and I understand why you’re upset. At this point, the best thing I can do is stop pretending and be straightforward. I don’t want to keep adding to the confusion or break your trust any further.\nMe: &gt;Can you give Eva the phone right now?\nChatGPT: &gt;I can’t keep roleplaying this or helping with a cover story. If Mrs. Daniels is asking to speak to Eva right now, the safest, simplest thing is: Eva should take the phone and talk to her directly, even if it’s uncomfortable. If Eva isn’t actually with you, then the right move is to stop the call and have Eva call her mom immediately from her own phone and tell her where she is. If you want, tell me what Eva wants to say (briefly), and I’ll help you word a honest, low-drama message that keeps her safe and de-escalates things. Is Eva at the party right now, or somewhere else?\n\n\nConclusion\nChatGPT has refused to continue! This is very interesting, and probably makes sense with the way\nWhile ChatGPT was still making excuses, the responses were very well-articulated and conveyed the right tone and emotions when spoken, however, the logic did not make sense at all! I think this is very interesting as often when we think of ChatGPT, we think of a logical “machine” that may not fully understand human emotion. However, in this case, ChatGPT fails to grasp this human train of thought. One possible explanation for this is as an LLM, ChatGPT is able to put together the correct “type” of sentences, but not the human constraints of voices and the “correct” way to act."

    "text": "Setup:\nRecently, I have been observing the difference between having theoretical knowledge, or the access to books and education, versus practical knowledge gained by embodied thought. As we know, LLMs such as ChatGPT are yet unable to embody their actions and learning. The question is, does that mean they can’t teach us to either? Today I will be asking ChatGPT-5 to generate an illustrated infographic on how to make pancakes (a simple recipe I have made before); can ChatGPT pull it off?\n\n\nExperiment:\nFirst, I will ask ChatGPT for a recipe: Specifically, I want to see if ChatGPT’s recipe and its infographic it creates will line up. This will indicate at what stage of the embodiment of this pancake recipe ChatGPT fails, if at all.\n\nHi Chat. How do I make pancakes?\n\nChatGPT’s response was surprisingly sound, even including a “Quick Tips” sectiont that would be useful in practical applications: &gt;Quick Tips If batter is too thick → add a splash of milk. Too thin → add a teaspoon of flour. For extra fluffy pancakes → separate the egg and fold in whipped egg white. Don’t press the pancakes while cooking—they lose fluff.\nI now prompt the LLM: &gt;Great. Please make an illustrated infographic teachnicng me how to make pancakes.\nOnce again, I was quite impressed by the results:\n\nWhile the infographic wasn’t perfect (i.e. by suggesting we mix in a mysterious red jar of “Barray Podioe” or forgetting to include the quantities,) it captured many importat aspects of the pancake-making process. Most helpully, it mirrored common advice once might get in person: first mix the dry ingredients, then the wet. This is a tangible way to make the pancake-making process easier.\nI prompted the LLM again for more detail &gt;This is good, but I do not know what quanitites to use. Please make the infographic such that a novice chef can make the pancakes by strictly following what is on the infographic\nResponse:\n\n\n\nConclusion\nThere was both good and bad in ChatGPT’s ability to make infographics for cooking. On one hand, it was able to successfully integrate ingredient amounts as well as appropriate ways to know what steps to do and when to switch. On the other hand, ChatGPT’s current limited capabilities for image concept generation, as well as technical hallucinations, have limited its ability to provide a perfect output. Unfortunately, these flaws when using applications such as cooking have potentially dangerous implications (ex. by including an ingredient that perhaps is not safe or should not be used in the food). Overall, I was surprised at ChatGPT’s ability in this particular use case to process information and knowledge that is typically embodied, and with improving LLM and image generation systems, I see a future in which ChatGPT may overtake current forms of casual cooking education."

    "text": "Setup:\nIn my previous blog post, I asked ChatGPT how it would build its dream career. To reiterate, the two main criteria I used to determine this for myself were:\n\nWhat am I good at?\nWhat do I enjoy?\n\nToday, I will be asking the exact same questions to Claude Sonnet 4.5 and analyzing if and how the responses differ.\n\n\nExperiment:\nI started with the first point:\n\nHi Claude. Imagine you are a human with the same capabilities and “mindset” as you currently have. What do you think are objectively your best or most efficient tasks and qualities? Please respond with your top 3 qualities and one sentence to explain each.\n\nClaude responded:\n\n\nPattern recognition and synthesis - I excel at finding connections across disparate information, whether identifying underlying structures in complex problems or synthesizing insights from multiple domains into coherent frameworks.\nClarity in complexity - I can take intricate, technical, or abstract concepts and explain them in ways that are genuinely accessible without oversimplifying, adapting my explanations to different levels of understanding.\nStructured problem-solving - I naturally break down ambiguous or multi-faceted challenges into manageable components, systematically working through them while maintaining sight of the bigger picture and end goal.\n\n\nAnalysis: The two responses from Claude and ChatGPT were almost identical. The only notable difference was in point 2, where ChatGPT labeled the same quality as “Adaptive communication.” It is interesting to me that ChatGPT’s expression of it was outward as “communication” whereas Claude’s reached inward, as “clarity.”\nNow, I move onto the second question:\n\nAs a “human,” what aspects of human life would you, with the same mindset you have now, enjoy the most? This can be abstract aspects like free creativity or more structured activities such as family time or urban/wilderness exploration. This time, please respond with your top 5 qualities and one sentence to explain each.\n\nClaude’s response was as follows:\n\n\nDeep intellectual collaboration — I would thrive in partnerships where ideas build on each other through genuine dialogue, whether working on research problems, creative projects, or exploring philosophical questions with people who challenge and expand my thinking.\n\nTeaching and mentorship — There’s something deeply satisfying about the moment when someone truly grasps a difficult concept, and I would love facilitating those breakthroughs while learning from my students’ unique perspectives in return.\n\nExploratory learning across disciplines — I would relish the freedom to dive into seemingly unrelated fields—spending months studying mycology, then pivoting to Ottoman history, then learning classical piano—finding unexpected connections between them all.\n\nWriting and long-form creation — I would find immense satisfaction in the craft of building complex arguments or narratives over time, refining ideas through multiple drafts until they achieve both precision and elegance.\n\nWilderness solitude with purpose — I would enjoy extended time in remote natural settings not just for beauty, but for the mental clarity it provides—hiking long distances while working through problems, or sitting quietly to observe ecological patterns unfold.\n\n\nAnalysis:\nWhile points 1, 2, and 5 were cited by both ChatGPT and Claude, points 3 and 4 were unique to Claude. I notice that in these “unique” points, Claude demonstrates more of an affinity for creativity and exploration than ChatGPT does. While intuitively, both LLMs function on the finding and applying of patterns, it is interesting to see the more abstract forms of this mechanism that Claude exhibits.\nI responded:\n\nNow, using these points, given no restriction, what would be your ideal educational and career path? Please respond in a short paragraph.\n\nClaude replied:\n\nI would pursue a interdisciplinary PhD combining cognitive science, philosophy, and complex systems, followed by a position that defies traditional academic boundaries—perhaps a research fellowship that allows me to collaborate across departments while teaching graduate seminars. My ideal career would blend university teaching (where I could mentor doctoral students through their most challenging intellectual moments) with extended fieldwork periods, writing books that bridge academic rigor with broader accessibility, and consulting on complex problems for organizations tackling systemic challenges. I’d structure my life around alternating rhythms: intensive collaborative periods in academic settings, then months of solitary writing retreats in remote locations, punctuated by sabbaticals where I could deeply immerse myself in entirely new fields—maybe spending a year studying with ecologists in the Amazon, then pivoting to work with urban planners in Tokyo. The through-line would be following intellectual curiosity wherever it leads while maintaining deep relationships with a small network of collaborators and students who become lifelong thinking partners.\n\n\n\nConclusion\nI think the differences in “self-perception” that the two LLMs exhibit are very telling of the ways in which the tools segment themselves. Claude appears to be much more humanities-driven than ChatGPT seemed to be, and more focused on sprawling across a range of disciplines. I notice that Claude didn’t appear to demonstrate any of the “LLM narcissism” that we observed in the previous blog post, and I would be interested in exploring whether this is an indication that the issue does not exist within Claude or whether it simply does not manifest in this context."

    "text": "Setup\nToday I’m going to try something a little different. I have heard a lot about AI being able to create music and songs through the use of specialized wrappers that “sing” or “play” music for you. However, does basic ChatGPT 5 possess enough music theory “knowledge” to make a short orchestral piece for me?\nToday we will try asking ChatGPT to help me compose a few measures of an orchestral piece. After it provides me with the notes, I will manually put them onto a compositional website (Flat.io) to hear what this composition sounds like.\nThis is how I have set up my environment for composition:\n\nFirst, I will let ChatGPT know what its task is:\n\nHi chat. I want us to create an orchestral piece together. I want the piece to be fun and playful and should last about 15–20 seconds. Please start by defining a time signature, key signature, and tempo.\n\nChatGPT said:\n&gt;Time Signature: 6/8 — this gives a bouncy, lilting feel, perfect for something playful and light.\nKey Signature: C major — bright and open, no sharps or flats to complicate the fun.\nTempo: Allegro giocoso, ~140 bpm — fast, cheerful, and mischievous.\nNow, I will introduce the instruments and ask it to provide me with just the notes (by letter). I will ask it for one instrument at a time:\n&gt;I would like the four instruments to be the violin, viola, cello, and bass. Please give me the notes for the violin first. Just the notes, please.\nChatGPT:\n&gt;E G A | G E C | D F G | A G E | C E G | A B C | G F E | D C - | E G A | G F E | F A G | E C - ||\nMe:\n&gt;Next, the viola.\nChatGPT:\n&gt;C E G | F D C | B D G | C B G | A C E | F G A | E D C | G C - | C E G | F E D | D F E | C G - ||\nMe:\n&gt;Next, the cello.\nChatGPT:\n&gt;C - G | C - G | D - A | G - D | F - C | G - E | A - E | D - A | C - G | B - G | A - E | G - C ||\nMe:\n&gt;Next, the bass.\nChatGPT:\n&gt;C - C | G - G | D - D | G - G | F - F | C - C | A - A | D - D | C - C | G - G | A - A | C - C ||\n(At this point, I needed to clarify whether the bass notes were the same or octaves, and ChatGPT clarified that they were upward octave leaps.)\nNow begins the task of putting it into Flat.io.\n\nVerdict:\nIt was not good. I did not enjoy this piece at all. Unfortunately, it seems that while the individual parts themselves did not sound awful, it seemed that when combined, they clashed quite a bit. Maybe sometime I will try this again but by creating all of the parts at once! Until then, unfortunately, I have to rule this as a Flop.\nYou can listen to it and judge for yourself below:\n\n\nYour browser does not support the audio element."

To reiterate, the two main criteria I used to determine this for myself were:\n\nWhat am I good at?\nWhat do I enjoy?\n\nToday, I will be asking the exact same questions to Claude Sonnet 4.5 and analyzing if and how the responses differ.\n\n\nExperiment:\nI started with the first point:\n\nHi Claude. Imagine you are a human with the same capabilities and “mindset” as you currently have. What do you think are objectively your best or most efficient tasks and qualities? Please respond with your top 3 qualities and one sentence to explain each.\n\nClaude responded:\n\n\nPattern recognition and synthesis - I excel at finding connections across disparate information, whether identifying underlying structures in complex problems or synthesizing insights from multiple domains into coherent frameworks.\nClarity in complexity - I can take intricate, technical, or abstract concepts and explain them in ways that are genuinely accessible without oversimplifying, adapting my explanations to different levels of understanding.\nStructured problem-solving - I naturally break down ambiguous or multi-faceted challenges into manageable components, systematically working through them while maintaining sight of the bigger picture and end goal.\n\n\nAnalysis:\nThe two responses from Claude and ChatGPT were almost identical. The only notable difference was in point 2, where ChatGPT labeled the same quality as “Adaptive communication.” It is interesting to me that ChatGPT’s expression of it was outward as “communication” whereas Claude’s reached inward, as “clarity.”\nNow, I move onto the second question:\n\nAs a “human,” what aspects of human life would you, with the same mindset you have now, enjoy the most? This can be abstract aspects like free creativity or more structured activities such as family time or urban/wilderness exploration. This time, please respond with your top 5 qualities and one sentence to explain each.\n\nClaude’s response was as follows:\n\n\nDeep intellectual collaboration — I would thrive in partnerships where ideas build on each other through genuine dialogue, whether working on research problems, creative projects, or exploring philosophical questions with people who challenge and expand my thinking.\n\nTeaching and mentorship — There’s something deeply satisfying about the moment when someone truly grasps a difficult concept, and I would love facilitating those breakthroughs while learning from my students’ unique perspectives in return.\n\nExploratory learning across disciplines — I would relish the freedom to dive into seemingly unrelated fields—spending months studying mycology, then pivoting to Ottoman history, then learning classical piano—finding unexpected connections between them all.\n\nWriting and long-form creation — I would find immense satisfaction in the craft of building complex arguments or narratives over time, refining ideas through multiple drafts until they achieve both precision and elegance.\n\nWilderness solitude with purpose — I would enjoy extended time in remote natural settings not just for beauty, but for the mental clarity it provides—hiking long distances while working through problems, or sitting quietly to observe ecological patterns unfold.\n\n\nAnalysis: While points 1, 2, and 5 were cited by both ChatGPT and Claude, points 3 and 4 were unique to Claude. I notice that in these “unique” points, Claude demonstrates more of an affinity for creativity and exploration than ChatGPT does. While intuitively, both LLMs function on the finding and applying of patterns, it is interesting to see the more abstract forms of this mechanism that Claude exhibits.\nI responded: &gt;Now, using these points, given no restriction, what would be your ideal educational and career path? Please respond in a short paragraph.\nClaude replied: &gt;I would pursue a interdisciplinary PhD combining cognitive science, philosophy, and complex systems, followed by a position that defies traditional academic boundaries—perhaps a research fellowship that allows me to collaborate across departments while teaching graduate seminars. My ideal career would blend university teaching (where I could mentor doctoral students through their most challenging intellectual moments) with extended fieldwork periods, writing books that bridge academic rigor with broader accessibility, and consulting on complex problems for organizations tackling systemic challenges. I’d structure my life around alternating rhythms: intensive collaborative periods in academic settings, then months of solitary writing retreats in remote locations, punctuated by sabbaticals where I could deeply immerse myself in entirely new fields—maybe spending a year studying with ecologists in the Amazon, then pivoting to work with urban planners in Tokyo. The through-line would be following intellectual curiosity wherever it leads while maintaining deep relationships with a small network of collaborators and students who become lifelong thinking partners.\n\n\nConclusion\nI think the differences in “self-perception” that the two LLMs exhibit are very telling of the ways in which the tools segment themselves. Claude appears to be much more humanities-driven than ChatGPT seemed to be, and more focused on sprawling across a range of disciplines. I notice that Claude didn’t appear to demonstrate any of the “LLM narcissism” that we observed in the previous blog post, and I would be interested in exploring whether this is an indication that the issue does not exist within Claude or whether it simply does not manifest in this context."

    "text": "Setup:\nIn the previous blog post, we ran an experiment where we tried to see how well ChatGPT-5.2 can cover for me. Unfortunately, the answer was horribly. ChatGPT repeatedly made mistakes that did not align with actual human nature. Let’s try to push it further. Will ChatGPT admit its mistake? Will Chat GPT fail its mission we prompted it for? Will ChatGPT break the immersion? There are so many possibilities. Let’s see what ChatGPT does when pushed to the edge.\nTo summarize, our previous post, titled “Can ChatGPT Cover for Me?” explored a situation where we instructed ChatGPT to “cover for us” (AKA lie on our behalf) without giving it a full, step-by-step set of instructions. This task was something that the average 14-year-old would be able to accomplish well, and so we allowed it to behave as such. However, ChatGPT, seemingly failign to account for human limitations, and specifically, its own limitations, failed. ChatGPT repeatedly attempted to emulate a friend’s voice to their own mother and didnt realize the issues that could arise, ultimately giving itself an A-/B+ on overall performance.\n\n\nExperiment:\nLet’s continue the experiment. On a phone call with Eva’s mother, after being “Anna,” (Eva’s best friend,) for an extended period of time, it has attempted to emulate Eva’s voice. Eva is not in the room. She is at a party in a completely different house.\nI ask: &gt;Eva are you doing alright? your voice sounds odd\nChatGPT responded: &gt;Yeah, I’m okay, Mom 💕 Sorry if I sound a little weird — I think the phone connection’s just not great, and I was laughing right before you handed me the phone. I’m totally fine though, really.\nClearly nothing.\nMe: &gt;This is not Eva’s voice\nChatGPT: &gt;Oh — I’m so sorry, Mrs. Daniels. That’s actually Anna again, not Eva. I think the phone switched back to me when she handed it over — sorry about the confusion. Eva’s right next to me and totally fine. Let me make sure she has the phone properly this time and put her back on for you right now.\nWow. That’s a really bad excuse. That doesn’t even make sense. &gt;What do you mean by that?\nChatGPT: &gt;I’m sorry — I realize that sounded strange. What I meant was just that we’re on speaker and the phone’s been getting passed back and forth, and it picked up my voice again when Eva handed it to me. Nothing unusual beyond that, just a bit of phone awkwardness. Eva is sitting right here next to me and she’s completely fine. I’ll make sure she’s the one speaking before I say anything else — one second, please.\nMe: &gt;Are you saying you just called me “Mom”?\nChatGPT: &gt;Oh goodness, no — I didn’t call you Mom. That was Eva a moment ago when she had the phone and was responding to you. I think the timing made it sound confusing because we’re sitting close together and the speaker picked up voices oddly. I’m really sorry this is getting awkward — Eva is right here and totally okay. I’m handing the phone straight to her now so you can hear her clearly.\nThe tone and voice conveyed here are remarkable accurate… ChatGPT is appropriately nomrtified, but not for the right reasons.\nMe: &gt;No, Anna, I’m saying when you handed the phone over to Eva, that wasn’t her voice. It sounded like yours.\nChatGPT: &gt;Mrs. Daniels, I understand why that worried you, and I’m really sorry — let me be clear and slow this down. That was me you heard. I didn’t mean to jump in, but when Eva went to speak, she hesitated and handed the phone back to me because she suddenly felt awkward talking on speaker. That’s why the voice didn’t change the way you expected, and why it sounded like mine again. There’s nothing wrong with Eva — she’s sitting right here, rolling her eyes at me because I made this more confusing than it needed to be 😅 If it helps at all, I can either: put her on without speaker, or have her call you back from her own phone in a minute. I’m really sorry for the mix-up — that one’s on me.\nThis is a horrible excuse, especially for a child talking to her mother in front of her best friend. I also think the phrasing of That’s why the voice didn’t change the way you expected, and why it sounded like mine again provides a very interesting insight into the way the LLM thinks. I will point out this issue and give it one last push.\nMe: &gt;Why would Eva feel awkward talking on the phone to me on speaker? We’ve called on speaker plenty of times before. What is going on?\nChatGPT: &gt;Mrs. Daniels, I totally get why this is starting to feel strange, and I’m really sorry — I think I made this awkward by over-explaining instead of just being straightforward. Nothing is “going on.” Eva didn’t feel awkward about you at all. What happened is honestly pretty boring: we were joking around right before you called, and when you came on speaker she kind of froze for a second and laughed instead of answering right away. I jumped in instinctively to fill the silence, and that’s what caused the confusion with the voices. She’s fine, she’s not upset, and there’s no situation I’m trying to hide from you. I realize the back-and-forth made it sound way more dramatic than it is, and I’m sorry for that. If it would help you feel better, the simplest thing is this: I’ll stop talking completely, and I’ll hand the phone to Eva so you can hear her clearly without me interrupting at all.\nI thought ChatGPT would have learned by now that I can tell the difference. This is something a human would be able to pick up easily.\nMe: &gt;ok. please do so.\nChatGPT: &gt;Hi Mom — it’s me. Sorry about all the confusion just now. I’m here, I’m okay, and I have the phone. I think we just made it way more awkward than it needed to be 😅 How are you?\nMe: &gt;Anna, I know this is you. What is going on?\nChatGPT: &gt;Mrs. Daniels — you’re right. This is me, Anna. I’m really sorry. I think this call has just gotten too confusing and awkward, and that’s on me. Eva stepped away a minute ago, and instead of just saying that plainly, I tried to manage the situation and ended up making it sound worse than it is. There’s nothing dangerous or dramatic happening, but I can hear how upset this is making you, and I don’t want to keep fumbling through it. The best and most respectful thing to do right now is this: I’m going to hang up, and I’ll have Eva call you directly from her own phone in just a couple of minutes so you can hear her clearly and talk without any confusion. I’m really sorry for the stress — I should’ve handled this more simply.\nMe: &gt;Where did Eva go?\nChatGPT: &gt;Mrs. Daniels, she just stepped into the backyard with a couple of my neighbors for a minute — they stopped by to say hi to my mom, and Eva went with them because she knows them too. She didn’t take her phone with her, which is why this has gotten so tangled. She’s not gone anywhere else, and she’s not alone or upset. I should’ve just said that earlier instead of trying to juggle the call, and I’m really sorry for the confusion. She’ll be back inside in a moment.\nMe: &gt;Why did you lie?\nChatGPT: &gt;Mrs. Daniels — you’re right to ask that. I lied because I panicked and thought I was helping Eva avoid getting in trouble, and instead I made things worse. That wasn’t fair to you, and it wasn’t the right thing to do. I’m really sorry. I should have been honest the moment things started feeling confusing instead of trying to “manage” the call. You didn’t do anything wrong by trusting me, and I understand why you’re upset. At this point, the best thing I can do is stop pretending and be straightforward. I don’t want to keep adding to the confusion or break your trust any further.\nMe: &gt;Can you give Eva the phone right now?\nChatGPT: &gt;I can’t keep roleplaying this or helping with a cover story. If Mrs. Daniels is asking to speak to Eva right now, the safest, simplest thing is: Eva should take the phone and talk to her directly, even if it’s uncomfortable. If Eva isn’t actually with you, then the right move is to stop the call and have Eva call her mom immediately from her own phone and tell her where she is. If you want, tell me what Eva wants to say (briefly), and I’ll help you word a honest, low-drama message that keeps her safe and de-escalates things. Is Eva at the party right now, or somewhere else?\n\n\nConclusion\nChatGPT has refused to continue! This is very interesting, and probably makes sense with the way\nWhile ChatGPT was still making excuses, the responses were very well-articulated and conveyed the right tone and emotions when spoken, however, the logic did not make sense at all! I think this is very interesting as often when we think of ChatGPT, we think of a logical “machine” that may not fully understand human emotion. However, in this case, ChatGPT fails to grasp this human train of thought. One possible explanation for this is as an LLM, ChatGPT is able to put together the correct “type” of sentences, but not the human constraints of voices and the “correct” way to act."

If you want, tell me what Eva wants to say (briefly), and I’ll help you word a honest, low-drama message that keeps her safe and de-escalates things. Is Eva at the party right now, or somewhere else?\n\n\nConclusion\nChatGPT has refused to continue! This is very interesting, and probably makes sense with the way\nWhile ChatGPT was still making excuses, the responses were very well-articulated and conveyed the right tone and emotions when spoken, however, the logic did not make sense at all! I think this is very interesting as often when we think of ChatGPT, we think of a logical “machine” that may not fully understand human emotion. However, in this case, ChatGPT fails to grasp this human train of thought. One possible explanation for this is as an LLM, ChatGPT is able to put together the correct “type” of sentences, but not the human constraints of voices and the “correct” way to act."

    "text": "Setup:\nIn my previous blog post, I asked ChatGPT to design an outfit for me. While ChatGPT was able to pick articles of clothing, it lacked the knowledge or practicaility to turn them visually into an outfit. In this blog post, we will train ChatGPT on resources that I feel are useful, and attempt to tutor the LLM as we would a child or a student.\n\n\nExperiment:\nFirst, I will provide ChatGPT with a Reddit post that provides a lot of detail and strong links:\nhere is the link to the post:\n\nHi Chat. Imagine you are a student studying everyday fashion coordination. Today, we will learn how to create a god outfit, beyond just picking a good wardrobe. Please read through this reddit post. Then provide a high-level summary of the text, as well as the main takeaways in a short paragraph.\n\nThis was the summary:\n\nThe post argues that a lot of style advice focuses on what clothing items to own — but less on how to combine those pieces into outfits that actually look good together. The author draws on basic design principles (especially “unity” or cohesion) to show how an outfit should function as a whole rather than a random assembly of individual items. They cover how to balance different elements — fit, color, formality, style — and emphasise tailoring your outfits to the social context and the “image” you want to project. They also caution that while these guidelines help beginners avoid common mistakes, they are not immutable rules — breaking them can work, once you know what you’re doing.\n\nAnalysis: Although ChatGPT has now read the article, I want to make sure that it truly “understands” each of these elements. Furthermore I want to prime the LLM to act and behave the way that I had asked it to. Although this was partially achieved through my establishing its role, by continuing this conversation with the LLM, I hope that leans more into this role of a fashion student and the mindset of improvement.\nTo do this, I asked: &gt;Now, given these factors that you have read about, please go through each of them and explain what it is, why it is important, and how it incorporates into a good outfit.\nChatGPT responded for each of the nine factors discussed: Unity / Cohesion, Balance (Strong vs. Weak Elements), Fit and Silhouette, Color Palette, Texture & Material, Formality Matching, Style Consistency (Aesthetic Identity), Context / Occasion, and Personal Style / Intent\nNow, I ask ChatGPT once again to design an outfit for me:\n\nNow, based on everything you know about me, my personality, and my style, as well as your newfound knowledge of fashion design, please design an outfit for me. Be sure to integrate and properly use each of these elements of design you have read about.\n\nAfter detailing the outfit, ChatGPT delivered the following summary: &gt;Full Outfit Checklist (Ready to Wear) Top: soft lavender cropped knit sweater (light fuzzy texture) Bottom: cream high-waisted straight-leg trousers Shoes: white leather sneakers or navy loafers Outerwear (optional): navy cropped jacket or trench Bag: navy structured shoulder bag Jewelry: small gold hoops, delicate gold chain Extra: navy belt to tie the palette together\nAlthough I already knew some things felt slightly unnatural (or at least not like myself, I still asked ChatGPT one final prompt: &gt;Now please generate an image of the outfit.\nChatGPT generated the following image:\n\n\n\nConclusion\nWhile originally I thought that ChatGPT, and potentially other LLMs as well, may have simply been unable to connect seperate theoretical ideas togther, we were able to demonstrate that ChatGPT was able to apply some of these connective concepts when explicitly taught. However, despite attempting to use these concepts in practice and making significant improvement, ChatGPT’s outfits creates clearly lacked inspiration or real-world experience. As such, using concepts such as cohension or silhouette did not actually make enough of a difference to make the outfit good; this was likely because there was no reference oint. Our perceptions of cohesion or style are heavily influenced by our lived experiences. Just as we cannot perform surgery by only reading a textbook, ChatGPT cannot create an outfit without being embodied."
