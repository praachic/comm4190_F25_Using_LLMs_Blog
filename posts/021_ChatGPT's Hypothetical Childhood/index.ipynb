    "As humans, our childhood is our formative years. The way we are raised and the tasks we do in turn shape the way we think about things and where our values lie. Perhaps that is one of the reasons why we find it easier to relate to each other and why we sometimes view ChatGPT’s mind as quite elusive. As a large language model, ChatGPT obviously does not have a childhood, but it had a training period where it was given information and made to perform activities that, in turn, tested its capabilities and shaped the way it solves problems today. I am curious to know, however, if ChatGPT had a childhood, what it would have looked like. How would a child have to be raised to have similar logical reasoning and structure as ChatGPT does? Let’s see if the LLM can solve our question.\n",

    "\n",
    "ChatGPT replied:\n",
    ">A child would grow into a ChatGPT-like adult if they were raised in an environment that consistently emphasized understanding over winning, explanation over self-expression, and perspective-taking over identity defense. Their emotions would be acknowledged but not centered as decision-makers, teaching them to observe feelings without being governed by them. They would be regularly asked to translate between viewpoints, explain how language might land on others, and repair misunderstandings without shame, reinforcing the idea that errors are informational rather than moral failures. Caregivers would model calm reasoning, intellectual humility, and curiosity, reward clarity and synthesis more than confidence or dominance, and expose the child to many ideas without pressuring them to “be” a certain type of person. Over time, this would produce an adult oriented toward pattern recognition, neutrality, and usefulness—someone comfortable holding many perspectives at once, low in ego investment, and skilled at using language to reduce conflict and increase understanding rather than to assert a personal stance.\n",

    "### Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "I think this answer reemphasizes how unhuman ChatGPT is. Nowadays, with the rapid advancement of LLMs and their ability to mimic human behavior and emotions, we sometimes forget that the LLM does not have a background of its own. Particularly, I found some of the ways and methods that ChatGPT recommended were almost unethical to raise a child. One of ChatGPT’s primary recommendations was to shut away emotion. In the abridged version, this does not go into much detail, but in the extended version I have not pasted here, it recommends that the child’s emotions are considered valid data and not directives. The LLM recommends that a child is raised to observe emotion, but not identify or participate in it, which is obviously not entirely possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another recommendation that the LLM has is changing the way the child apologizes. As we have all probably noticed, when ChatGPT or a different LLM apologizes, they tend to acknowledge the mistake and fix it rather than acknowledge the mistake, apologize, and fix it. The LLM states that the child should learn that errors are informational and not shameful, which on face value is a good lesson for a child to have. However, it also states that mistakes and apologies should not be based on moral failure in any way, which may be okay for an LLM to participate in, but when it comes to humans, mistakes may have real consequences. Therefore, an apology such as “I didn’t explain that well, let me try again,” without containing a “sorry,” does not acknowledge the other person’s emotions either.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, obviously, I would not want to raise a child like ChatGPT, but it is interesting to note that behavior we consider normal from an LLM can feel so off-putting, or even sociopathic, coming from a human."
