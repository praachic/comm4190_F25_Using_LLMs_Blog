    "\n",
    "We’re going to play a game. I will first ask Claude to prepare three poetic passages, each containing some degree of emotional nuance. I then want to give these poems to ChatGPT and see if the LLM can figure out the emotions Claude chose. I’m curious to see whether these emotional baselines are the same across LLMs, and I’m also curious to see whether I, as a human, will interpret them the same way the LLMs do."

    "### Experiment:\n",
    "\n",
    "**I started by prompting Claude:**\n",
    "\n",
    ">Hi Claude! Today we’re going to play a game. I want you to write three short poetry passages about two classmates working on a project together for a college linguistics class. I want the three passages to be almost identical, but in one, the main character is in love with the other, in one, the main character is envious of the other, and in one the main character secretly hates the other. The goal is to make the emotions as subtle as possible so someone else who reads them may have difficulty guessing which is which.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Here are Claude's three poems! Can you guess which is which?**\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Claude1.png\" width=\"50%\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Claude2.png\" width=\"50%\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Claude3.png\" width=\"50%\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "My guess will be \n",
    "1. Love\n",
    "2. Anger (*\"already knowing where this leads\"* feels resentful, harsh)\n",
    "3. Envy (*\" write down your words carefully\"* feels like the other person knows more and *\"making sure I understand the distinctions\"* could allude to an inferiority complex)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Let's see if ChatGPT agrees with me:**\n",
    ">hi chat. I have prepared three poetic passages for you. please identify which primary emotion is conveyed in each. Please answer in the form of: \"Passage [x]: [Emotion]\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**ChatGPT replied:**\n",
    "> 1. Passage One: Admiration\n",
    "> 2. Passage Two: Resignation\n",
    "> 3. Passage Three: Focused curiosity\n",
    "\n",
    "I noticed that while the first passage somewhat lined up, the three adjectives used were highly specific. \n",
    "**I provide a bit more guidance:**\n",
    "> ok. if I tell you that the three reflect love, envy, and hatred, which do you think is which?\n",
    "\n",
    "**ChatGPT now answers:**\n",
    ">Here’s how I would map them, based on tone, attention, and implied stance toward the other person:\n",
    ">1. **Passage One: Love**\n",
    "The attention is tender and absorbing. The speaker lingers on precise details (hands, pauses, certainty) without resistance or foreknowledge. Writing the words “exactly” suggests devotion, alignment, and a desire to mirror rather than diverge.\n",
    ">2. **Passage Two: Envy**\n",
    "The key shift is already knowing where this leads. The repetition feels heavy rather than intimate. The speaker watches with awareness edged by comparison and inevitability—knowledge without closeness, anticipation without warmth.\n",
    ">3. **Passage Three: Hatred**\n",
    "The tone is controlled, clipped, and instrumental. Attention is no longer on you but on correctness and distinction. “Carefully” and “making sure I understand” signal distance, vigilance, and a refusal to be absorbed—engagement without affection.\n",
    "\n",
    "For good measure, I also asked a friend what they thought about the three passages:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"FriendClaude.png\" width=\"30%\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Now, let's see what the intended answer was. I ask Claude:**\n",
    ">Which is which?\n",
    "\n",
    "Claude replies:\n",
    ">Here's the reveal:\n",
    "\n",
    ">**Passage One = In love**\n",
    ">* \"write down your words exactly\" (treasuring everything they say)\n",
    ">* \"watching how your hand moves\" (intimate attention to details)\n",
    ">* \"so certain of where the boundaries fall\" (admiration for their confidence)\n",
    "\n",
    ">**Passage Two = Envy**\n",
    ">* \"write down your words\" (no modifier—more mechanical)\n",
    ">* \"already knowing where this leads\" (resentment of predictability, feeling like the dynamic is fixed with them always in the teaching role)\n",
    ">* The clipped ending suggests frustration with the power dynamic\n",
    "\n",
    ">**Passage Three = Secret hatred**\n",
    ">* \"write down your words carefully\" (performing the role of good partner)\n",
    ">* \"making sure I understand the distinctions\" (the facade of patience, emphasis on their condescending explanation)\n",
    ">* The politeness feels most forced and controlled"

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "I think it was interesting to note that while the emotions were nuanced, neither of the two human participants were able to identify them, while both of the LLM participants were in consensus about the emotions displayed. I think that when it comes to complicated emotions, the differences in responses between me and my friend showed that human emotions are complicated and manifest themselves differently in different people. That being said, in real life, when people express certain emotions, we are typically able to understand them quite easily, sometimes with the assistance of visual cues such as body language or facial expression as well. With the LLMs, however, I thought it was interesting that they were able to understand each other’s emotions because they draw from similar resources and have a set template for what anger should look like, or envy, or hatred, which causes all of their emotions to be copy-paste. I would be interested to know what you guess the emotions might be prior to reading the document."
