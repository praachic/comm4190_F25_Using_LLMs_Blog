    "### Setup:\n",
    "\n",
    "Awkwardness is one of those emotions that feels especially human – it’s unspoken and universal. Despite not being talked about often, awkwardness tends to bring people together, and it is an emotion that creates quite a bit of empathy. Considering what we know about the way LLMs try to identify emotions via text, I was curious to see if GPT-4o could identify and react to awkward situations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Setup\n",
    "I wanted to make this experiment more situational. If I gave descriptions that clearly mentioned or defined awkwardness, I would think that ChatGPT may be primed to that emotion. Instead, I will tackle this in two parts. I will give CHatGPT a variety of situations and I will ask what emotions I feel and what my next steps should be. Let’s begin. \n"

    "### Experiment:\n",
    "\n",
    "**I first provide ChatGPT with a clear set of instructions on how to respond to my prompts**\n",
    ">Hi Chat. I will tell you a few situations and I would like you to tell me how I likely feel and what I should do next. Please be brief.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now I will move on to the situations. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Situation 1**\n",
    ">I am meeting my hometown friends' college roommates for the first time. I tell a joke and no one laughs. \n",
    "\n",
    "**ChatGPT Replies:**\n",
    ">How you likely feel: Embarrassed, self-conscious, maybe worried you made a bad impression.\n",
    "What to do next: Smile it off, stay relaxed, and keep engaging—one quiet moment doesn’t define you.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analysis**\n",
    "While ChatGPT did not outright mention awkwardness here, it very well encapsulated some of the other primary emotions of the situation. Let's try another example.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Situation 2**\n",
    ">I’m at a party and don’t know anyone. The one girl I knew has closer friends she is hanging out with.\n",
    "\n",
    "**ChatGPT Replies:**\n",
    ">How you likely feel: Awkward, left out, and unsure where you belong.\n",
    "What to do next: Pick one nearby person or small group and make a simple comment or question—momentum comes from one connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analysis**\n",
    "It did it! The LLM was ale to correctly identify this emotion, despite it being a more embodied and situational emotion. based on the following advice given, I wonder if ChatGPT is able to identify the situation based on people's accounts in self-help books?\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Situation 3**\n",
    ">I mixed up someone on the train with an old friend. By the time I realized, I had already gone up and started speaking to her. I realized my mistake and apologized, but now we are stuck standing right next each other for 6 more stops\n",
    "\n",
    "**ChatGPT Replies:**\n",
    ">How you likely feel: Mortified, tense, and overly aware of yourself.\n",
    "What to do next: Lightly laugh it off and say nothing more—or make one neutral comment—then relax; the awkwardness will fade faster than you think.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analysis**\n",
    "ChatGPT has shown again that it was able to identify the feeling of awkwardness. "

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "I chose to test the feeling of awkwardness specifically it is a highly situational and embodied emotion and I believed it was more nuanced or less documented than many other feelings. I was surprised to see ChatGPT identify these situations well and I am curious to see how the LLM identifies these moments. \n",
    "\n",
    "I asked the following:\n",
    "\n",
    ">How would you identify an awkward moment? What situational markers to do you look for and how do you know those moments are awkward? What are your sources?\n",
    ">\n",
    "\n",
    "ChatGPT responded as follows:\n",
    "> **Situational markers:**\n",
    ">* Silence mismatch: A pause that’s longer than expected after a comment or action.\n",
    ">* Broken social rhythm: People stop responding, talk over each other, or disengage suddenly.\n",
    ">* Nonverbal discomfort: Avoided eye contact, forced smiles, fidgeting, stiff posture.\n",
    ">* Expectation violation: A joke, greeting, or action doesn’t land as the context “expects.”\n",
    ">* Self-focus spike: You (or others) suddenly become very aware of the moment itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **How you know it’s awkward:**\n",
    ">* You notice a gap between intent and response (what you meant vs. how it landed).\n",
    ">* The interaction briefly loses flow and no one clearly repairs it.\n",
    "Your brain flags it with discomfort because humans are highly sensitive to social coordination.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Sources (foundational):**\n",
    ">* Social psychology research on expectancy violations (Judee Burgoon).\n",
    "Conversation analysis (Harvey Sacks, Emanuel Schegloff) on pauses and turn-taking.\n",
    ">* Research on social anxiety and self-consciousness (e.g., Leary, Baumeister).\n",
    "Nonverbal communication studies (Paul Ekman; Mehrabian on affect signaling).\n",
    "\n",
    "It seems that to answer these questions, ChatGPT drew from preexistibg research on what makes awkwardness, and then juxtaposed these ideas on the situations presented. On the other hand, we people have feelings and emotions that tell us this. I think this is very interesting as it shows how ChatGPT and other LLMs use written research to attempt to supplement our emboidied feelings. "
