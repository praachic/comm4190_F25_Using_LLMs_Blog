    "### Setup:\n",
    "Recently, I began planning a giveaway event for the Penn student body. In my leadership role as a director of Penn’s SPEC Pop Up, my co-directors and I regularly plan events throughout the school year. \n",
    "\n",
    "On Wednesday, the general body members (GBMers) of our organization decided on a theme and title they wanted for our upcoming event – The Fall I Turned Cozy. It seemed that people either loved the name or hated it. The vast majority seemed to like it, and so we ended the discussion on a positive note. \n",
    "\n",
    "To those unaware, this is a reference to the popular TV show, The Summer I Turned Pretty. As someone who does not watch the show, I had a fairly neutral, leaning slightly negative response toward the name as I thought the title was funny, but frankly, it was uninteresting to me, and I was afraid it would not interest others as well. I was curious to see what ChatGPT-5 would think of it. \n",
    "\n",
    "As such, I asked Chat to simulate a survey for me."

    "I found this response not only interesting in the ways ChatGPT tends to characterize people, but also quite insightful—it provided a neutral perspective I wasn’t previously familiar with. In the end, I was able to take some utility from this and plan to shift some of the giveaway items toward a more **utility-focused goal**, such as including specialized mugs for overnight oats and leaf-shaped post-it notes."
