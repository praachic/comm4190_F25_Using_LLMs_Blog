    "How good is ChatGPT at reading the room and being tactful? In different situations with different people, we, as members of society, know that there are specific ways to act. Those norms change depending on who we’re with and how close we are. Today, both ChatGPT and I are going to take a tactfulness quiz, and we will see if the LLM knows how to act in the correct situations.\n",

    "### Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "While there are many markers of human connection that ChatGPT does not understand, I am impressed with ChatGPT’s performance on this quiz. I was curious to know how the addition of potential dishonesty would play into ChatGPT’s prioritization of tact. Notably, the only answer choice that changed was the one involving the best friend who asked specifically, and that is a change that I would agree with. Something I noticed is that even though I did this in a temporary chat, ChatGPT explicitly said prior to answering the questions that it would prioritize tact and kindness. I think it is nice that, despite me not stating the nature of the quiz, the LLM was able to infer the reasoning behind it, adding a potential marker of social awareness.\n",
    "\n",
    "I suppose when it comes to concepts such as tact or etiquette, there is enough documented work on what should and should not be done that the LLM is able to correctly identify the situations. "
