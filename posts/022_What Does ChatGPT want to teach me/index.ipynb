    "### Setup:\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, I am going to be asking ChatGPT to teach me something new. I'm a huge fan of fun facts, but I know they can be quite reliable, so I will be asking ChatGPT-5.2 to back it up by research. I'm interested to see the direction in which this will go, because I use ChatGPT pretty frequently. As you may have noticed, most of my blog features the use of ChatGPT rather than other LLMs, unless I make an intentional decision to do otherwise (such as changing LLMs to compare answers). This is because through years and years of use, ChatGPT knows a lot about my structure and interests, and I think when exploring LLMs, it's important to note that everybody's LLM behaves slightly differently. I think that based off of what ChatGPT knows about me, it may pick a topic that I have been asking it about pretty frequently, such as finance, psychology, music, or even about itself/AI.\n"

    "### Experiment:\n",
    "\n",
    "**I start by asking it to teach me something:**\n",
    ">Hi chat. Teach me something new you think I would be interested in, such as a fun fact backed by research\n",
    "\n",
    "**ChatGPT Responded as follows:**\n",
    ">**🧠 Fun Fact: Using the word “you” can make a message feel more hostile—even when the content is identical**\n",
    "**What’s surprising:**\n",
    "Simply swapping “I” for “you” in a sentence can change how confrontational it feels, even if nothing else changes.\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "> * “I think we should rethink this approach.” → sounds collaborative\n",
    "> * “You should rethink this approach.” → sounds accusatory\n",
    "Same idea. Very different emotional impact.\n",
    "*[The LLM continues explaining this topic to me]*\n",
    "\n",
    "This is very funny. The “new” fact that He has tried to teach me is one thatCame directly from a research paper I asked it to read. I had specifically prompted it a few weeks ago to make sure I was understanding the paper correctly and it mimicked it back to me!\n",
    "\n",
    "I ask the LLM why it thinks I do not know this, and it answered that it is because it is a complex topic.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    " **I chose to reframe my question:**\n",
    "> Chat, this comes directly from a paper I asked you to read!\n",
    "\n",
    "**ChatGPT responded**\n",
    "> You’re right — and thank you for calling that out. That’s on me.\n",
    "*[ … ]*\n",
    "> You do know this concept academically — you’ve encountered it as findings, results, and arguments in the paper. What was new (or newly salient) is the reframing:\n",
    ">* pulling it out of “paper mode”\n",
    ">* naming it as a general mechanism\n",
    ">* and connecting it cleanly to everyday communication, power, and design choices\n",
    "\n",
    "Once again, ChatGPT appears to think that a paper is some sort of entity of its own, as we saw in the Yes Day experiment. Very odd. \n",
    "\n",
    "**I will rephrase my prompt to be more explicit:**\n",
    ">ok. Consider that anything we have already talked about is something I know. Please teach me something different and this time. Do not relate this to anything we have already explicitly discussed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**ChatGPT Responded:**\n",
    ">Fun fact: Every time you remember something, you change it\n",
    "This isn’t metaphorical. It’s a documented cognitive process called memory reconsolidation.\n",
    "> The core finding\n",
    "When you recall a memory, your brain does not simply “play it back.”\n",
    "Instead:\n",
    "The memory becomes temporarily unstable (labile)\n",
    "New information, emotions, or context can alter it\n",
    "The memory is then stored again in its updated form\n",
    "So remembering is closer to rewriting than retrieving.\n",
    "Naturally, I was a little skeptical, so I went ahead and googled it. \n",
    "Good news!\n",
    "\n",
    "Super interesting!"

    "### Analysis\n",
    "While the prompt experiment had initially failed, I found that with further prompt modification ChatGPT was able to correctly fulfill what I had asked it. It is interesting that in the initial response it appeared that the LLM had forgotten the source of its prior stored memory. Since ChatGPT had clearly accessed this paper from our backlog of topics we had spoken about, I would have expected it to also remember that it was I who had given it that paper and that I was the one who had gone into detail about the specific portions of that paper I wanted it to help me understand. Even after we pivoted, I noticed that ChatGPT stayed on a similar track in terms of content that we had started on, namely psychological research. Overall, I would count this experiment as a success due to the change after prompting. In a future post, I would like to go further into why Chat forgets the source of its memories.\n"
