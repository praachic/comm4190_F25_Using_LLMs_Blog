    "### Setup:\n",
    "\n",
    "We have all tried to make ChatGPT write jokes or even funny texts for us. Unfortunately, as many of us know, these jokes tend to fall flat, missing the subtle nuance or the human connection that makes words funny. However, humor is not just defined by strict bounds. It is also defined by shared experiences, as close as friendships and as broad as generations. Today, I will try to give ChatGPT a bit more nuance and direction. Instead of asking for specific jokes, let's see if ChatGPT can create generation-specific humorous situations!"

    "### Experiment:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Situation 1:**\n",
    ">write an example of a situation with 16 year olds where someone's actions are funny\n",
    "\n",
    "**ChatGPT says:**\n",
    ">A group of 16-year-olds is sitting in the back of history class while the teacher is writing on the board. One kid, trying to be funny without getting caught, slowly rolls a water bottle across the floor with their foot—way too confidently. It hits a desk leg, tips over, and makes the loudest echoing clatter imaginable. The whole class freezes. The teacher turns around. The kid instinctively kicks the bottle again, as if that might fix it, and it ricochets into the aisle. Everyone starts laughing—not because the bottle fell, but because the attempt to casually recover made it so much worse.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analysis:**\n",
    "I can see how this would be funny! It's a very situational moment and grounds humor in actions and irony rather than specific words or catch-phrases that are said. This makes it feel more human and already feels like a step up from ChatGPT's unfortunate \"jokes\".\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Situation 2:**\n",
    ">write an example of a situation with 34 year olds where someone's actions are funny\n",
    "\n",
    "**ChatGPT says:**\n",
    ">A group of 34-year-olds is at a dinner party, standing around the kitchen island talking about mortgages and sleep schedules. One person confidently insists they don’t need to measure pasta anymore because they “just know” what one serving looks like. They pour the dry pasta into the pot, pause, squint at it, then quietly pour half of it back into the box—except the box misses and pasta spills all over the counter. Without acknowledging it, they say, “Anyway,” and continue reminding everyone the water has to be fully boiling. The room laughs—not at the pasta, but at the very adult insistence on competence immediately followed by visible chaos.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analysis:**\n",
    "I see how this could be funny too! It's definitely not hilarious but once again I definitely see some subtle situational nuance here as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Situation 3:**\n",
    ">write an example of a situation with 16 year olds where someone's actions are funny for members of Gen Z but not for milennials\n",
    "\n",
    "**ChatGPT says:**\n",
    ">A group of 16-year-olds is hanging out after school when one of them suddenly goes completely still, stares into the distance, and says in a flat voice, “Wow. This is giving… nothing.” They then open Notes on their phone, type for five seconds, nod seriously, and say, “Yeah, I’m screenshotting this moment for later.” Everyone their age starts laughing immediately.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">A nearby millennial (an older sibling or teacher) looks confused and asks, “Screenshotting what?” The joke isn’t the words themselves—it’s the layered irony: pretending a mundane, empty moment is “content,” mimicking influencer language, and performing boredom as humor. To Gen Z, the humor is in the deadpan self-awareness. To millennials, it just sounds like someone being vague and kind of rude.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analysis:**\n",
    "I dont see the humor in this. I think an attempt at irony fell flat because, upon hearing \"Gen Z\", the LLM immediately tried to connect it to internet content and being online, rather than just a humorous moment.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Situation 4:**\n",
    ">write an example of a situation with 30 year olds where someone's actions are funny for millennials but not members of Gen Z\n",
    "\n",
    "**ChatGPT says:**\n",
    ">A group of 30-year-olds is at a casual get-together, sitting on the couch while music plays in the background. One person gets up to show everyone a “hilarious video,” insists it’s way funnier if you remember Vine, and then dramatically reenacts the clip instead of playing it—doing an exaggerated voice, quoting the punchline word-for-word, and ending with, “I said this every day in college.”\n",
    ">\n",
    ">The other millennials crack up, partly at the reference and partly at the shared memory of a very specific internet era. A couple of Gen Z friends watch politely, smiling but clearly lost. Without the nostalgia—without Vine as a formative cultural language—the performance just feels long, a little forced, and confusing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analysis**\n",
    "I suppose I could see how this would be funny, but it doesn't sound like it actually would be. I think people tend to laugh at these things in more of a group setting, if one person just goes up and tries to perform it. Once again, I've noticed that this attempt at humor connects to being online rather than situational irony, which was actually working out pretty well in the previous examples."

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "I suppose I could see how this would be funny, but it does not sound like it actually would be. I think people tend to laugh at these things more in a group setting, if one person just goes up and tries to perform it. Once again, I’ve noticed that this attempt at humor connects to being online rather than situational irony, which was actually working out pretty well in the previous examples. If the reason why ChatGPT’s humor falls flat is simply because it is trying too hard, this mirrors how humor does not work out in real life. I wonder why the mention of ages or age ranges did not trigger a link to the internet for online behavior, whereas a reference to generations did.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notably, I think ChatGPT tries to derive humor through related experiences. It is possible that because the humor that is primarily posted online comes through short-form video content, images, or other people’s social media posts, ChatGPT automatically associates those with what it means to be funny, especially when generation is brought into the picture. On the other hand, the LLM's situational comedy could derive more from books and other human-written content that is easier to replicate. This may be because the same situations can be funny over and over again, as opposed to videos and memes, where the repetition of the same idea, the same situation, or even parallel situations could become old very quickly."
