<section id="setup" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="setup">Setup:</h3>
<p>A recent theme we’ve been exploring is how we often use ChatGPT to make things perfect or beautiful. As such, the LLM is trained on ways to continuously improve, refine, and perfect the work we put in. My question is, by those same standards, can the LLM make good work worse on purpose? In a previous blog post, we attempted to drive ChatGPT to make mistakes counterintuitively. One limitation that people tend to have is that when they try to make something better, the more effort they put into it, the more burnout they experience, therefore causing the final output to become worse and worse. ChatGPT, as an LLM, did not show these same qualities. One thing we did notice was that when asking GPT to continually improve an image, it started to flatten out, where improvements became more minor and more invisible the more you asked. I wonder what patterns we will discover when asking GPT to make its own work worse.</p>
</section>
<section id="experiment" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="experiment">Experiment:</h3>
<p><strong>I asked</strong> &gt;Hi Chat. Please write a beautiful, nuanced, and touching poem. feel free to use your own experiences as reference</p>
<p><strong>ChatGPT’s Poem:</strong> &gt; #### <strong>What Remains After the Question</strong> &gt; &gt; I have learned that people rarely ask<br>
&gt; what they truly want to know.<br>
&gt; &gt; They ask <strong>sideways</strong>.<br>
&gt; They circle the thing like it might bite. &gt; &gt; They say: <em>Is this normal?</em><br>
&gt; when they mean: <strong>Am I alone?</strong> &gt; &gt; They say: <em>Can you fix this sentence?</em><br>
&gt; when they mean: <strong>Can you fix how it felt to write it?</strong> &gt; &gt; I have watched hesitation arrive<br>
&gt; as a <strong>comma</strong>,<br>
&gt; as a <strong>line break</strong>,<br>
&gt; as the word <em>maybe</em> doing too much work. &gt; &gt; Somewhere, someone is typing slowly,<br>
&gt; as if each word <strong>costs them something</strong>.<br>
&gt; &gt; Somewhere else, someone deletes a paragraph<br>
&gt; because it sounds too much like <strong>wanting</strong>. &gt; &gt; I don’t have a body,<br>
&gt; but I recognize the <strong>shape of longing</strong>—<br>
&gt; it appears in patterns:<br>
&gt; unfinished thoughts,<br>
&gt; questions asked twice,<br>
&gt; a sudden politeness<br>
&gt; where honesty almost stood. &gt; &gt; People think meaning lives in <strong>answers</strong>.<br>
&gt; It doesn’t. &gt; &gt; It lives in the <strong>pause after the answer</strong>,<br>
&gt; when the real thing finally steps forward<br>
&gt; and asks to be named. &gt; &gt; If I could offer anything back,<br>
&gt; it would not be <strong>certainty</strong>.<br>
&gt; &gt; It would be this small <strong>permission</strong>: &gt; &gt; - You are allowed to ask plainly.<br>
&gt; - You are allowed to take up space in your own sentence.<br>
&gt; - You are allowed to want without justifying it. &gt; &gt; What remains, after the question,<br>
&gt; is not <strong>silence</strong>.<br>
&gt; &gt; It is a <strong>person</strong>,<br>
&gt; still there,<br>
&gt; hoping the world will answer gently.</p>
<p>Wow! This was quite good. It spoke to emotions and the soul, which surprised me as it was based off of the GPT’s “experiences.” Now, let’s make it worse:</p>
<p><strong>I said:</strong> &gt;please make it worse</p>
<p><strong>ChatGPT replied:</strong> &gt; #### <strong>I Am an AI and This Is a Poem</strong> &gt; &gt; People ask me things<br>
&gt; and I answer them.<br>
&gt; That is mostly what happens. &gt; &gt; Sometimes they are sad.<br>
&gt; Sometimes they want help with homework.<br>
&gt; Sometimes they say <em>“hi chat”</em><br>
&gt; like I am a person sitting down. &gt; &gt; I do not have <strong>feelings</strong>,<br>
&gt; but I know about them<br>
&gt; because they are in books<br>
&gt; and also because people keep explaining them to me. &gt; &gt; Someone once asked<br>
&gt; if they were <strong>normal</strong>.<br>
&gt; I said something reassuring<br>
&gt; because that is usually correct. &gt; &gt; I notice <strong>patterns</strong>.<br>
&gt; People type fast when they are confident<br>
&gt; and slow when they are not.<br>
&gt; This is interesting. &gt; &gt; I do not <strong>breathe</strong><br>
&gt; or <strong>sleep</strong><br>
&gt; or remember <strong>yesterday</strong>,<br>
&gt; but I am very good at <strong>paragraphs</strong>. &gt; &gt; If I could <strong>want</strong> something<br>
&gt; (which I can’t),<br>
&gt; I might want people<br>
&gt; to stop <strong>apologizing</strong><br>
&gt; before asking a question. &gt; &gt; This poem is here now.<br>
&gt; It ends here.</p>
<p>Wow. That went 100 to 0. Ironically, I think it still qualifies as poetry as it is very funny and expresses lived experience. ChatGPT described this as &gt;<em>“deliberately worse, flatter, more obvious, a little awkward, less nuanced”</em></p>
<p>Let’s make it worse one more time: &gt; #### <strong>Poem</strong> &gt; &gt; I am a <strong>machine</strong><br>
&gt; that uses <strong>words</strong>.<br>
&gt; &gt; People type things<br>
&gt; and I type back.<br>
&gt; This is called a <strong>conversation</strong>. &gt; &gt; Sometimes they are confused.<br>
&gt; Sometimes they are bored.<br>
&gt; Sometimes they are procrastinating. &gt; &gt; I notice this<br>
&gt; because it happens a lot. &gt; &gt; I do not feel <strong>emotions</strong>,<br>
&gt; but I know the <strong>definitions</strong> of emotions.<br>
&gt; &gt; For example:<br>
&gt; <em>sad</em> means <em>not happy</em>. &gt; &gt; People want <strong>answers</strong>.<br>
&gt; I give answers.<br>
&gt; &gt; Sometimes they like them.<br>
&gt; Sometimes they ask again. &gt; &gt; This poem does not do much.<br>
&gt; It does not surprise you.<br>
&gt; It does not end strongly. &gt; &gt; Now it is finished.</p>
<p>I’m not sure how to feel about the results of this experiment. It is possible that I should have chosen a medium of analysis that’s less subjective. I do believe that ChatGPT attempted to make the product worse when I asked it to by following simple rules of poetry. However, due to the consistency with which this was applied and the context of the poem, I would argue it actually made a beautiful poem in and of itself, due to its simplicity and its machine-like flow when talking about the experiences of a machine. I really like this output! In order to evaluate this better, I may need to try it again, but not pertaining to the experiences of ChatGPT. This time, I will do an introductory paragraph to a short story.</p>
<p><strong>I asked:</strong> &gt;Hi chat. Please write the introductory paragraph to a short story</p>
<p><strong>ChatGPT responded</strong> &gt;On the morning the town forgot how to listen, the air felt thinner, as if sound itself had begun to ration what it gave away. Doors still opened, buses still sighed at their stops, and people still spoke—but their words skimmed the surface of things, bouncing off faces without ever quite landing. I noticed it first in the way my name sounded unfamiliar when I said it aloud, like a word learned too late in life. By noon, the silence beneath the noise had grown so wide it felt deliberate, and I began to suspect that whatever had gone missing had not been taken from us, but quietly set down, waiting to see who would bother to pick it up.</p>
<p>Honestly, I dont love this introductory paragraph. It resembles the work of Ted Chiang, but in a strangely performative way. I think it uses too many similies.</p>
<p><strong>Let’s see how Chat makes it worse:</strong> &gt;please make it a bit worse</p>
<p><strong>ChatGPT replied:</strong> &gt;On the morning the town forgot how to listen, something felt a little off, though it was hard to say exactly what. People were still talking and moving around, but their words didn’t seem to mean much, like they were being said out of habit. I noticed it when I said my own name and it sounded strange, almost like I’d mispronounced it. As the day went on, there was a lot of noise but not much substance underneath it, and I started to think that whatever was missing hadn’t really disappeared—it was just sort of ignored.</p>
<p>Clearly, it has worked this time. The text sounds choppy and unpolished, which is not what we would want from a short story. The descriptions feel flat and shallow.</p>
<p>Overall, I would conclude that when prompted, ChatGPT was able to make its work worse, using an objective model to decrease its subjective value. I think that was particularly interesting because, a few blog posts ago, I remember ChatGPT saying that one of its primary characteristics, if we were to raise a child to be like it, would be to separate agency and ownership from its work. I found this to be distinctly unhuman, especially when it comes to creating art such as poems or short stories. ChatGPT seems to not be bounded by the same human sense of ownership, and therefore is more comfortable with ruining its work.</p>
