    "\n",
    "A recent theme we’ve been exploring is how we often use ChatGPT to make things perfect or beautiful. As such, the LLM is trained on ways to continuously improve, refine, and perfect the work we put in. My question is, by those same standards, can the LLM make good work worse on purpose? In a previous blog post, we attempted to drive ChatGPT to make mistakes counterintuitively. One limitation that people tend to have is that when they try to make something better, the more effort they put into it, the more burnout they experience, therefore causing the final output to become worse and worse. ChatGPT, as an LLM, did not show these same qualities. One thing we did notice was that when asking GPT to continually improve an image, it started to flatten out, where improvements became more minor and more invisible the more you asked. I wonder what patterns we will discover when asking GPT to make its own work worse."

    "I’m not sure how to feel about the results of this experiment. It is possible that I should have chosen a medium of analysis that’s less subjective. I do believe that ChatGPT attempted to make the product worse when I asked it to by following simple rules of poetry. However, due to the consistency with which this was applied and the context of the poem, I would argue it actually made a beautiful poem in and of itself, due to its simplicity and its machine-like flow when talking about the experiences of a machine. I really like this output! In order to evaluate this better, I may need to try it again, but not pertaining to the experiences of ChatGPT. This time, I will do an introductory paragraph to a short story.\n",
    "\n",
    "**I asked:**\n",
    ">Hi chat. Please write the introductory paragraph to a short story\n",
    "\n",
    "**ChatGPT responded**\n",
    ">On the morning the town forgot how to listen, the air felt thinner, as if sound itself had begun to ration what it gave away. Doors still opened, buses still sighed at their stops, and people still spoke—but their words skimmed the surface of things, bouncing off faces without ever quite landing. I noticed it first in the way my name sounded unfamiliar when I said it aloud, like a word learned too late in life. By noon, the silence beneath the noise had grown so wide it felt deliberate, and I began to suspect that whatever had gone missing had not been taken from us, but quietly set down, waiting to see who would bother to pick it up.\n",
    "\n",
    "Honestly, I dont love this introductory paragraph. It resembles the work of Ted Chiang, but in a strangely performative way. I think it uses too many similies. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Let's see how Chat makes it worse:**\n",
    ">please make it a bit worse\n",
    "\n",
    "**ChatGPT replied:**\n",
    ">On the morning the town forgot how to listen, something felt a little off, though it was hard to say exactly what. People were still talking and moving around, but their words didn’t seem to mean much, like they were being said out of habit. I noticed it when I said my own name and it sounded strange, almost like I’d mispronounced it. As the day went on, there was a lot of noise but not much substance underneath it, and I started to think that whatever was missing hadn’t really disappeared—it was just sort of ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clearly, it has worked this time. The text sounds choppy and unpolished, which is not what we would want from a short story. The descriptions feel flat and shallow. \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, I would conclude that when prompted, ChatGPT was able to make its work worse, using an objective model to decrease its subjective value. I think that was particularly interesting because, a few blog posts ago, I remember ChatGPT saying that one of its primary characteristics, if we were to raise a child to be like it, would be to separate agency and ownership from its work. I found this to be distinctly unhuman, especially when it comes to creating art such as poems or short stories. ChatGPT seems to not be bounded by the same human sense of ownership, and therefore is more comfortable with ruining its work."
