    "### Setup:\n",
    "\n",
    "Recently, I have been observing the difference between having theoretical knowledge, or the access to books and education, versus practical knowledge gained by embodied thought. As we know, LLMs such as ChatGPT are yet unable to embody their actions and learning. The question is, does that mean they can't teach us to either? Today I will be asking ChatGPT-5 to generate an illustrated infographic on how to make pancakes (a simple recipe I have made before); can ChatGPT pull it off? "

    "### Experiment:\n",
    "\n",
    "**First, I will ask ChatGPT for a recipe:**\n",
    "Specifically, I want to see if ChatGPT's recipe and its infographic it creates will line up. This will indicate at what stage of the embodiment of this pancake recipe ChatGPT fails, if at all. \n",
    "\n",
    ">Hi Chat. How do I make pancakes?\n",
    "\n",
    "**ChatGPT's response was surprisingly sound, even including a \"Quick Tips\" sectiont that would be useful in practical applications:**\n",
    ">Quick Tips\n",
    "If batter is too thick → add a splash of milk.\n",
    "Too thin → add a teaspoon of flour.\n",
    "For extra fluffy pancakes → separate the egg and fold in whipped egg white.\n",
    "Don’t press the pancakes while cooking—they lose fluff.\n",
    "\n",
    "**I now prompt the LLM:**\n",
    ">Great. Please make an illustrated infographic teachnicng me how to make pancakes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Once again, I was quite impressed by the results:**\n",
    "\n",
    "![](PancakeInfographic.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "While the infographic wasn't perfect (i.e. by suggesting we mix in a mysterious red jar of \"Barray Podioe\" or forgetting to include the quantities,) it captured many importat aspects of the pancake-making process. Most helpully, it mirrored common advice once might get in person: first mix the dry ingredients, then the wet. This is a tangible way to make the  pancake-making process easier. \n",
    "\n",
    "**I prompted the LLM again for more detail**\n",
    ">This is good, but I do not know what quanitites to use. Please make the infographic such that a novice chef can make the pancakes by strictly following what is on the infographic\n",

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "There was both good and bad in ChatGPT’s ability to make infographics for cooking. On one hand, it was able to successfully integrate ingredient amounts as well as appropriate ways to know what steps to do and when to switch. On the other hand, ChatGPT’s current limited capabilities for image concept generation, as well as technical hallucinations, have limited its ability to provide a perfect output. Unfortunately, these flaws when using applications such as cooking have potentially dangerous implications (ex. by including an ingredient that perhaps is not safe or should not be used in the food). Overall, I was surprised at ChatGPT’s ability in this particular use case to process information and knowledge that is typically embodied, and with improving LLM and image generation systems, I see a future in which ChatGPT may overtake current forms of casual cooking education."
