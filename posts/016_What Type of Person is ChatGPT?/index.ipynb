    "In my previous blog post, I asked ChatGPT to design an outfit for me. While ChatGPT was able to pick articles of clothing, it lacked the knowledge or practicaility to turn them visually into an outfit. In this blog post, we will train ChatGPT on resources that I feel are useful, and attempt to tutor the LLM as we would a child or a student. "

    "### Experiment:\n",
    "\n",
    "**First, I will provide ChatGPT with a Reddit post that provides a lot of detail and strong links:**\n",
    "here is the [link to the post](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/19qc8c/a_rudimentary_guide_on_creating_outfits_that_work/): \n",
    "\n",
    ">Hi Chat. Imagine you are a student studying everyday fashion coordination. Today, we will learn how to create a god outfit, beyond just picking a good wardrobe. Please read through this reddit post. Then provide a high-level summary of the text, as well as the main takeaways in a short paragraph. \n",
    "\n",
    "**This was the summary:**\n",
    "\n",
    ">The post argues that a lot of style advice focuses on what clothing items to own — but less on how to combine those pieces into outfits that actually look good together. The author draws on basic design principles (especially “unity” or cohesion) to show how an outfit should function as a whole rather than a random assembly of individual items. They cover how to balance different elements — fit, color, formality, style — and emphasise tailoring your outfits to the social context and the “image” you want to project. They also caution that while these guidelines help beginners avoid common mistakes, they are not immutable rules — breaking them can work, once you know what you’re doing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analysis:**\n",
    "Although ChatGPT has now read the article, I want to make sure that it truly “understands” each of these elements. Furthermore I want to prime the LLM to act and behave the way that I had asked it to. Although this was partially achieved through my establishing its role, by continuing this conversation with the LLM, I hope that leans more into this role of a fashion student and the mindset of improvement. \n",
    "\n",
    "**To do this, I asked:**\n",
    ">Now, given these factors that you have read about, please go through each of them and explain what it is, why it is important, and how it incorporates into a good outfit. \n",
    "\n",
    "**ChatGPT responded for each of the nine factors discussed:** Unity / Cohesion, Balance (Strong vs. Weak Elements), Fit and Silhouette, Color Palette, Texture & Material, Formality Matching, Style Consistency (Aesthetic Identity), Context / Occasion, and Personal Style / Intent\n",
    "\n",
    "**Now, I ask ChatGPT once again to design an outfit for me:**\n",
    "\n",
    ">Now, based on everything you know about me, my personality, and my style, as well as your newfound knowledge of fashion design, please design an outfit for me. Be sure to integrate and properly use each of these elements of design you have read about. \n",
    "\n",
    "**After detailing the outfit, ChatGPT delivered the following summary:**\n",
    ">Full Outfit Checklist (Ready to Wear)\n",
    "Top: soft lavender cropped knit sweater (light fuzzy texture)\n",
    "Bottom: cream high-waisted straight-leg trousers\n",
    "Shoes: white leather sneakers or navy loafers\n",
    "Outerwear (optional): navy cropped jacket or trench\n",
    "Bag: navy structured shoulder bag\n",
    "Jewelry: small gold hoops, delicate gold chain\n",
    "Extra: navy belt to tie the palette together\n",
    "\n",
    "Although I already knew some things felt slightly unnatural (or at least not like *myself,* I still asked ChatGPT one final prompt: \n",
    ">Now please generate an image of the outfit.\n",

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "While originally I thought that ChatGPT, and potentially other LLMs as well, may have simply been unable to connect seperate theoretical ideas togther, we were able to demonstrate that ChatGPT was able to apply some of these connective concepts when explicitly taught. However, despite attempting to use these concepts in practice and making significant improvement, ChatGPT's outfits creates clearly lacked inspiration or real-world experience. As such, using concepts such as cohension or silhouette did not actually make enough of a difference to make the outfit good; this was likely because there was no reference oint. Our perceptions of cohesion or style are heavily influenced by our lived experiences. Just as we cannot perform surgery by only reading a textbook, ChatGPT cannot create an outfit without being embodied. "
