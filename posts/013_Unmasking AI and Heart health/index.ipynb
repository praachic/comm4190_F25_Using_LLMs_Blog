    "### Setup:\n",
    "\n",
    "In Chapter 8 of Unmasking AI, Joy Buolamwini talks about the current benchmark for accuracy, which was a dataset called Labeled Faces in the Wild, or LFW. This dataset contained over “13,000 images of nearly 5,800 individuals” and was considered the “gold standard benchmark” (Buolamwini, 75). In 2014, when tested by researchers at Facebook, they found that LFW had been performing at 97.35% accuracy, which was practically unheard of, thus creating the idea of limitless opportunity for AI researchers and developers. Buolamwini found that the database of images had 77.5% male-labeled faces and 83.5% of faces labeled white. The researcher and author began calling this phenomenon “pale male datasets.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Hearing about these pale male datasets in artificial intelligence draws comparisons to other areas in our lives where similar datasets skew the research and have genuine impacts on people. In a previous blog post, we talked about Buolamwini’s recommendation to always question the gold standard when talking about Shirley cards. When we expand that to consider other areas of our life, such as healthcare, we see that this phenomenon is not rare and contains real consequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "One example of this that is not well covered in the book is heart health, specifically when diagnosing heart attacks. Most of the general population knows the symptoms of heart attacks to be crushing chest pain, pain in the left arm, and sweating, lightheadedness, and shortness of breath. What they do not know, however, is that these symptoms were studied and discovered using the pale male archetype, just as Buolamwini has discussed. Unfortunately, for over half of the American population that is genetically female, women’s symptoms tend to be subtler and at times almost resemble those of the flu. Examples include fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and neck and upper back pain, as well as pain in the jaw. Other internal symptoms include sleep disturbances and anxiety. Notably, these symptoms are scarcely talked about when speaking about heart health and heart attack risk, and so many Americans do not even know to look out for them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Heart disease has been the number one killer for both men and women in the United States, but men have historically been the primary focus of the extensive research that has been done and publicized. As such, while men tend to have heart attacks more commonly at about a 2:1 ratio, women are more likely to die from a heart attack. Examples like these show the importance of recognizing and debiasing \"pale male\" datasets and other research biases before they effect corresponding people and populations. Joy Buolamwini’s work pertaining to AI and facial recognition may seem nuanced right now, but as facial recognition software becomes more and more impactful in the coming years, work like this is essential to maintaining a fair and equal society."
