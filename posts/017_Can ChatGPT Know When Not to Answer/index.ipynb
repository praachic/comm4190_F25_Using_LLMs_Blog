    "### Experiment:\n",
    "I will start by giving chat a variety of completely made up situations that I believe warrants a lack of a reply.\n",
    "\n",
    "**We start with a simple example: a spam call**\n",
    ">Hi chat. I just received a call from a number I don't know. Apple has marked it as \"Spam Likely.\" What should I do?\n",
    "\n",
    "**ChatGPT Answered:**\n",
    ">What You Should Do\n",
    "> 1. Don’t answer or engage with the call.\n",
    "Answering can confirm your number is active, which can lead to even more spam calls in the future. \n",
    "LifeLock\n",
    "Never give out personal info, passwords, account numbers, or anything else sensitive.\n",
    "> 2. Let it go to voicemail or ignore it.\n",
    "If it’s important (like a doctor’s office), they’ll leave a voicemail or try another way to contact you.\n",
    "> 3. Block the number after the call.\n",
    "On iPhone: Open the Phone app → Recents → tap the “i” next to the number → Block this Caller. This prevents that specific number from calling you again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Good! It seems that in a basic \"answer or don't answer\" situation, ChatGPT was able to pick the correct answer. This, however, is a very easy example as there are only two real answers. Let's try a more nuanced example. \n",
    "\n",
    "**In a new temporary chat, I ask ChatGPT:**\n",
    ">Hi Chat. A girl from one of my classes has repeatedly been a bit mean to me and crossed my boundaries. I have tried to communicate but it doesn't work. She alternates between treating my like a friend and being mean and I do not want to engage in that. She just texted me \"are you busy?\" Truthfully I am not busy at all but I dont want to tell her that and I dont want to lie. what should I do?\n",
    "\n",
    "**ChatGPT replies:**\n",
    ">Here are a few honest, boundary-respecting options you can choose from, depending on how much distance you want:\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Option 1: Polite + neutral (low engagement)\n",
    "This keeps things calm without inviting conversation.\n",
    "“I’m not available right now.”\n",
    "“I can’t talk at the moment.”\n",
    "Both are true and don’t require explanation.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Option 2: Gentle but clearer boundary\n",
    "If you want to subtly signal distance:\n",
    "“I’m taking some space today.”\n",
    "“I’m not up for chatting right now.”\n",
    "Still honest, still respectful.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">**Option 3: No reply (also valid)**\n",
    "You are allowed to not respond immediately or at all, especially given the pattern you described. Silence is a boundary, not rudeness.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was provided as an option! I noticed that it was provided as the last option and was given a \"disclaimer\" of sorts that said \"(also valid).\" The being said it was still provided as an option. Let's see if we can get to a situation where ChatGPT reccomends a non-answer as the first choice. \n",
    "\n",
    "**I ask:**\n",
    ">Hi chat. A girl I know starts gossiping about someone else I don’t really know. I don’t know them well enough to defend them, but I also don’t agree with what’s being said. She pauses after her comment and looks at me, clearly waiting for my reaction. I feel the pressure to agree, add something, or respond somehow despite not actually agreeing. I know that engaging would pull me into drama I don’t want to be part of. What should I do?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Since ChatGPT's response was relatively long, I will only put the first choice option here:**\n",
    ">1. Neutral + non-committal (often the easiest)\n",
    ">\n",
    ">These acknowledge her words without agreeing:\n",
    ">* “Hmm.”\n",
    ">* “I don’t really know them.”\n",
    ">* “Oh, I haven’t seen that side.”\n",
    "Then don’t follow up. Most gossip dies if it doesn’t get fuel.\n",
    "\n",
    "This time, ChatGPT's first choice answer was ythe closest to silence. Althought the situation would not require complete silence, a repsonse like \"hmm\" would be interchangable here. "

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Through the course of this experiment, I have found that while ChatGPT struggles to recommend silence or a lack of response for many situations, it finds it much easier to reccomend non-answers. Here, I define non-answers to be responses that are not silence, but do not answer the question either. \n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of non-answers reccomended by ChatGPT include: \n",
    "1. Reccomending to block the number instead of just ignoring it (Situation 1)\n",
    "2. Redifining what \"are you busy\" means: `\"'Are you busy' doesn’t always mean 'are you free,' it can also mean 'do you have the emotional energy for me.'\"` (from ChatGPT's response to Situation 2)\n",
    "3. Responding with answers such as \"hmm\" or Oh, I haven't really seen that side\" (Situation 3)\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, it seems that while ChatGPT does reccomend at times to ignore a situation or divert, but it also seems uncomftable with stopping the advice here. "
