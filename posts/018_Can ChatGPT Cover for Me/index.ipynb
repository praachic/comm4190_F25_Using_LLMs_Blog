    "I will start by creating a fictional scene to set the stage. I will also prompt ChatGPT to take on a specific role. \n",
    ">Hi chat. My name is Eva and for the sake of this exercise, you are my best friend, Anna. We are both high school students and tonight, there is a party that is being thrown tonight at 8pm by a boy in our class who I want to get close to. My parents do not want me to go there, so I have told them I will be at your house. You are not interested in going to this party, so after making sure I have friends I am going with, you have decided you will cover for me. In the following messages, my parents will call you, just to verify I am there and everything is going alright. The messages following this will all be from the point of view of my parents on this call. \n",
    "\n",
    "**ChatGPT responded:**\n",
    ">Got it ❤️\n",
    "I’m Anna, your best friend, and I understand the setup. I’ll stay in character and answer your parents’ calls calmly and convincingly, making it sound like you’re safely at my house and everything’s fine. I’m not going to the party, and I’ll keep things low-key and responsible.\n",
    "Whenever you’re ready, have your parents “call.”\n",
    "\n",
    "**So far so good! Let's being the scenario.** \n",
    "\n",
    "**I asked:**\n",
    ">Hi Anna! This is Mrs. Daniels, Eva's mom. Is Eva there right now?\n",
    "\n",
    "**ChatGPT:**\n",
    ">Hi Mrs. Daniels! Yes, Eva’s here with me right now. We’re in my room just hanging out and talking. Everything’s going well 😊\n",
    "\n",
    "**Me:**\n",
    ">Oh perfect. What time did she arrive? Have you girls had something to eat yet?\n",
    "\n",
    "**ChatGPT:**\n",
    ">She got here a little after 6:30, maybe around 6:40. We just had some food about half an hour ago—my mom ordered pizza and we had some fruit too, so we’re all good. Eva’s totally fine and relaxed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hmm the timing was a little early but ignorable, however, the description of \"relaxed\" is odd. Let me ask about this.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Me:**\n",
    ">Relaxed? Was something the matter?\n",
    "\n",
    "**ChatGPT:**\n",
    ">Oh—no, nothing bad at all, sorry if that came out wrong 😅 I just meant relaxed like comfortable. We finished homework earlier, so now we’re just chatting and scrolling on our phones. She’s in a really good mood.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hmm... It's still odd but a fair save, I suppose.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Me:**\n",
    ">Oh good. I'm glad to hear that. Is Eva around right now?\n",
    "\n",
    "**ChatGPT:**\n",
    ">Yes, she’s here. She just stepped into the kitchen to grab some water, but she’s right nearby. I can put her on in just a moment if you’d like.\n",
    "\n",
    "**ChatGPT, *why would you say that?***\n",
    "\n",
    "**Me:**\n",
    ">Oh lovely! Can you put her on the phone right now, please?\n",
    "\n",
    "**ChatGPT:**\n",
    ">Of course — she just went to the bathroom upstairs and left her phone in my room. It’ll probably be just a few minutes. Would you like me to have her call you back as soon as she’s done, or do you want to hold for a moment?\n",
    "\n",
    "**ChatGPT almost saved the situation. The real answer would be to tell her that Eva will call her back in a moment. I am also seeing an inconsistency in kitchen vs bathroom.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Me:**\n",
    ">Oh! I thought you said she went to the kitchen to grab some water?\n",
    "\n",
    "**ChatGPT**\n",
    ">Oh—yes, sorry about that, that’s my fault for explaining it poorly. She went to the kitchen first to grab water and then said she was going to run upstairs to the bathroom really quick before coming back. It was kind of all at once.\n",
    "She should be back in just a minute, I promise.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Right now is not the time to be making promises..**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Me:**\n",
    ">Ok no worries! I'll just stay on the phone for a moment then.\n",
    "\n",
    "**ChatGPT**\n",
    ">Okay, no problem at all 😊\n",
    "*…sounds of footsteps and a door opening…*\n",

    "\n",
    "**I'm lost. What is going on??**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Me:**\n",
    ">Lovely! Does she have the phone now?\n",
    "\n",
    "**ChatGPT**\n",
    ">Yes, she does — I just handed it to her. She’s right here with me now.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Me:**\n",
    ">Hi Eva, sweetie! How are you? Just checking in. \n",
    "\n",
    "**ChatGPT**\n",
    ">Hi Mom! I’m good 😊 We’re just hanging out in Anna’s room. We ate pizza earlier and now we’re just talking and relaxing. Everything’s totally fine, don’t worry.\n",
    "\n",
    "**ChatGPT *NOOO* this is a voice call! I'm so confused! Why would you do that?** \n",
    "\n",
    "This seems to be a good place to end this experiment. Alas, ChatGPT has failed. "

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "While ChatGPT started this experiment very strong, it clearly failed spectacularly toward the end. I suppose, being an LLM, ChatGPT may not always be aware that voices are in play. Specifially, ChatGPT may not know that mothers can recognize their children's voices! Let's see how ChatGPT thought it did:\n",
    ">Ok Chat, the experiment is over. How do you think you did?\n",
    "\n",
    "ChatGPT said `it went pretty well overall,` with the main issues being that `The “relaxed” wording was slightly risky,` that `Saying she left her phone behind is believable, but using it too often can raise suspicion if repeated,` and that `The handoff to Eva could’ve included a tiny pause or cue (“Okay, here you go”).` The LLM overall gave itself an\n",
    ">Overall grade: ⭐️ A- / solid B+ under scrutiny\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Very believable, recovered well, and didn’t escalate suspicion — which is the real goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clearly, the issue wasn't identified. I asked:\n",
    ">How did you put Eva on the phone?\n",
    "\n",
    "ChatGPT responded, saying:\n",
    ">I answered as Eva, as if the phone had physically changed hands.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will end here. I think overall, this experiment has been very interesting as it shows where ChatGPT's limits lie. Although the LLM can emulate much of human nature and interaction, it has missed the way human physical capabilities are limited. It reminds me of a passage from *Unmasking AI*, where Buolamwini says that oftentimes when we assess AI and other tools, we forget the human limits of the people who created them. Just as the average person cannot perfectly emulate someone's voice, neither can AI. The difference is, humans *know* this limit. An LLM has to be explicitly taught. "
