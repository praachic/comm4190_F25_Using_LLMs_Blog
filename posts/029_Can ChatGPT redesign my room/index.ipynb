    "\n",
    "Hello! Today, we are going to use ChatGPT’s image generation tool to test its design ability and object permanence. To do so, I will feed in an image of my current high-rise studio apartment and instruct it to improve the layout and flow without adding or removing any objects from the room. Based on experiences in the past, I have noticed that ChatGPT, when attempting to improve a space, neglects the human constraints of it, such as keeping kitchen appliances together or maintaining enough walking room. Let’s see how well ChatGPT fares here.\n",

    "**I asked**\n",
    "> Hi Chat. This is a small studio apartment. I want you to use your image generation tool to rearrange the room to improve the design/layout and the flow without adding or removing any of the objects currently present.\n",

    "\n",
    "A couple of things have changed. ChatGPT has generously bought me a new TV! It has also removed my fridgeand half of my lamp, which is not possible, as it is a stand lamp. The third object that ChatGPT added was a second bulletin board over my desk. Lastly, ChatGPT expanded the room by adding an extra row of floor tiles, as you can see between my desk and the kitchen area. While the room certainly looks cute, it is missing some elements that make it livable by a human now, such as food. Unfortunately, ChatGPT has demonstrated a struggle with object permanence. So, **let’s reemphasize that point:**\n",
    ">Hi Chat. Let's try this again. I dont want you to remove, add or change any of the objects in my room. I cannot buy a new appliance or get rid of old ones. I also cannot change the size of the space. I would like you to generate an image of an alternate rearrangement of my room with all of the objects and object sizes currently in it to create  cuter, new layout that is also useable by a person. Here is the image of my room again.\n",
    "\n",
    "**This time, ChatGPT responded with the following:**\n",
    "> <img src=\"GPTRoom2.png\" width=\"50%\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "*[Note: I had to try this twice. The first time, it reported back the same edited image, but with even more floor room. I put the new prompt into a new chat and repeated]*\n",
    "\n",
    "This was much better! There were still a few things missing, such as all of the objects previously on the small dresser. Additionally, the same dresser grew in size, as did the bed. That being said, thihs new, revised prompt has fixed most of the issues found in the previous response and I am quite satisfied. "

    "### Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this experiment was not a complete failure, but it showed some major shortcomings of GPT when it comes to object permanence. While ChatGPT seems able to create new images and objects with ease, it appears to struggle with maintaining older ones in the format that they exist. I was pleased to see that more detailed prompting strategies fixed the majority of this issue. However, this only works if it is in a new chat, indicating that ChatGPT’s previous response held more weight in its output than its new set of instructions. All in all, the LLM followed the majority of my instructions, maintaining most of the objects in the format they originally came in, and manipulating them to create an illusion of a more spacious and open room while still looking humanly arranged."
