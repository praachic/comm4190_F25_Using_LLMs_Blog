    "### Setup:\n",
    "\n",
    "As you've probably noticed by now, I use ChatGPT a lot.I am on the upgraded plan and I have been using it for a few years now.Since ChatGPT knows so much about my personality and my interactions with it, I'm wondering how it believes these interactions will translate into real life.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, I will be asking ChatGPT to design an outfit for me. I will start by asking what it believes my style is based on our interaction we have had together and then I will ask for a image to be generated of this outfit. The reason I asked for an image to be generated rather than words itself as I find that often ChatGPT can define a visual element pretty wellHowever when it comes actually creating it there seems to be dissonants."

    "I thought it was quite interesting how ChatGPT attempted to create direct links between behavioral links and style. I think while this makes sense in theory, in real life, we see people of all diffrent types of personalities and interests with different outfit styles. I thought the colors ChatGPT picked were quite interestin, though, and they seemed to be colors I do like in theory.\n",

    "\n",
    "Once again, Similarly to the `Flop or Bop` situation, I think Chat GPT ad some idea of what might sound right in theory and yet not hit the mark on execution. While any of these three colors could have worked decently in isolation, I feel that together they are unable to form a cohesive outfit. ChatGPT un fortunately was unable to generate a wearable outfit for me."

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "I think ChatGPT's linkage of traits to  olors and images was a good start for a GPT. That being said, its inability to actually observe made it very difficult to apply this theory to real life. As such, in a pattern similar to the music notes that we saw and the `Flop or Bop` example, each individual article of clothing is pretty as a standalone piece however when we're together they do not create a wearable outfit. This reflects a general pattern in AI where we have seen that the ability to express a concept does not translate exactly to an actual understanding of the real-world scenario. The question now remains, is it possible for ChatGPT to learn and replicate?"
