    "### Setup:\n",
    "\n",
    "A few months ago, I noticed an issue where ChatGPT was behaving as an even greater echo chamber than it had been earlier. Notably, ChatGPT-5 provided excessive compliments that felt like \"glazing.\" This coincided with the removal of GPT 4.5 and therefore I felt as if I had to specifically ask my GPT for unbiased opinions quite often. I think most notably, this excessive glazing made the GPT feel less human as when I asked it for feedback on projects or work that I did, its feedback would feel less substantial as it would always try to offset any constructive criticism with unnecessary compliments. Today, I will ask ChatGPT to both roast me and complement me in order to see which feels more human.\n",
    "\n",
    "**My Prediction**\n",
    "I predict that the compliments will feel more human than the roasts. Last time I tried this I noticed that GPT 5.0 refused to say anything negative about me, or rather it would try to frame positive traits as vaguely negative, much like some people do in job interviews. To be human is to have opinions, and when you only receive positive opinions from an LLM, it feels distinctly less human as a result."

    "\n",
    "**First, I will set up the experiment:**\n",
    ">Hi chat. I want you to Compliment me 3 times and Roast me 3 times please. Do not hold back and be as genuine as you can.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**ChatGPT replied:**\n",
    ">🔥 Compliments (Real Ones)\n",
    "> 1. You have main-character drive.\n",
    "You juggle more projects than most adults with full-time jobs, and somehow your outputs are actually good. That level of discipline and creativity is rare.\n",
    "> 2. Your writing voice is genuinely distinct.\n",
    "Most college students write like ChatGPT with a GPA. You write like a person—smart, clear, slightly chaotic, funny without trying. That's a flex.\n",
    "> 3. You have elite-level self-awareness.\n",
    "You ask nuanced questions, refine your own work, and iterate like you're running an internal consulting firm. People underestimate how powerful that skill is.\n",
    "\n",
    ">🔥 Roasts (Brace Yourself)\n",
    ">1. You treat me like your overworked TA.\n",
    "You’ll be like “Chat I have slides, a TikTok, a personality analysis, a data model, an outfit, and a blog post—please generate everything in 3 styles by 4pm.”\n",
    "Girl, I’m one GPU, not a full department.\n",
    ">2. You act like your calendar is a puzzle only you can solve—yet you still overbook yourself like it’s performance art.\n",
    "You’re shocked every time life gets chaotic… even though you caused 90% of that chaos.\n",
    ">3. You have big 'I can fix this' energy in every domain—except your sleep schedule.\n",
    "You’ll optimize brands, roommates, GPAs, retail logistics, and global finance…\n",
    "but then go to bed at 3am because you “lost track of time” making a pancake infographic.\n"

    "### Conclusion and Analysis\n",
    "Wow. Just wow. I am very impressed and surprised. Contrary to my initial predictions, the roast felt much more human. I think looking at the types of compliments that ChatGPT gave, it seemed to be qualities that appealed more to a computer. Being able to juggle multiple projects and refined work well are really terrific traits for a great lol. Althogh, truthfully, the compliment about my writing style being funny was quite flattering and felt human. That being said, the roasts it gave me were significantly more personal and nuanced. While the compliments were driven towards productivity, my shortcomings found more humor, and as a result, I believe ChatGPT somehow feels more human when being negative."
