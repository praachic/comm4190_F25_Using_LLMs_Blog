    "Today I’m going to try something a little different. I have heard a lot about AI being able to create music and songs through the use of specialized wrappers that “sing” or “play” music for you. However, does basic ChatGPT 5 possess enough music theory “knowledge” to make a short orchestral piece for me? \n",

    "**ChatGPT said:**  \n",

Unfortunately, it seems that while the individual parts themselves did not sound awful, it seemed that when combined, they clashed quite a bit. Maybe sometime I will try this again but by creating all of the parts at once! Until then, unfortunately, I have to rule this as a Flop. \n"
