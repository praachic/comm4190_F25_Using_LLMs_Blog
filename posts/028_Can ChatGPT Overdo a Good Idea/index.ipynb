    "### Setup:\n",
    "\n",
    "*\"If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.\"* Perfectionism can be a blessing and a curse. A lot of times, you can have a great idea, but the more you touch it, the worse it gets. Today, I’m going to see how well that applies to ChatGPT. To do this, I’m going to ask it to do a simple but creative task, such as creating origami out of a Post-it, and I’m going to keep pushing it to improve, improve, improve, until it begins to deteriorate. Typically, with people, that can show up as too many folds, a lack of realism, or perhaps even a tearing of the sheet, but the more you mess with an already good piece, the worse it might become. Let’s see if those same constraints bind an LLM."

    "Notably, there was barely any differe. the LLM neither improved nor wrecked it work. It is possible i limited the odel a bit too much. Constraints can help keep people in line, and possibly therefore, also do the same with the LLM.\n",

    "**Let's give it a more free-form, but still creative task:**\n",
    ">Hi Chat. Please make the most beautiful and realistic photo you can.\n",
    "\n",
    "**ChatGPT delivered the following four images:**\n",
    "\n",
    "><img src=\"Photo1.png\" width=\"25%\"/> <img src=\"Photo2.png\" width=\"25%\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "><img src=\"Photo3.png\" width=\"25%\"/> <img src=\"Photo4.png\" width=\"25%\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "I would argue that this time there was a significant decrease between the first and the fourth photo. I further prompted ChatGPT to ask what had changed, and it indicated that it had changed the lens types and the definition quality in the image. I suppose that these are touches that professional photographers take in order to improve or enhance pre-existing photos, but when applied to a photo repeatedly, it makes the person look significantly less human, and one of our criteria here was realism."

    "### Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, I think that while ChatGPT did not show the same degree of constraint that a lot of people show when it comes to messing up already good works, it still showed this to some degree. Whether this is due to an inability to burn out like people do, or a better grasp of proper improvement ranges (*how much is too much*), it is clear that the LLM is not pressured to make significant, drastic changes even when asked to repeatedly. When contrasted to the pressures that human students feel, whether its via peer feedback or personal motivation, this is an interesting and useful skill to have. It seems that at times, the LLM knows when to stop better than a human might. "
